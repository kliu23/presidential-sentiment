        "intro": "President Biden addresses the American people to make the case for why US support for Ukraine and Israel is crucial. As Ukraine fights Russia and Israel fights the terrorist organization Hamas, the United States must continue to show up for its allies. President Biden announces that he is sending an urgent budget request to Congress to fund America's national security needs, supporting \"our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine.\"",
        "transcript": " Good evening, my fellow Americans. We\u2019re facing an inflection point in history\u2014one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to talk with you about tonight.You know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. They tell me I\u2019m the first American president to travel there during a war.I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October.More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents\u2014from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans\u2014taken hostage.As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we\u2019re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage.The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others.In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain.I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people\u2019s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don\u2019t take that right away.Like so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza\u2014which was not done by the Israelis.We mourn every innocent life lost. We can\u2019t ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity.You know, the assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine\u2014people that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his all-out invasion.We\u2019ve have not forgotten the mass graves, the bodies found bearing signs of torture, rape used as a weapon by the Russians, and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia, stolen from their parents. It\u2019s sick.Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy\u2014completely annihilate it.Hamas\u2014its stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them.Meanwhile, Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood. He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine. And just two weeks ago, he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdraw\u2014and if the United States withdraw, our allies will as well\u2014military support for Ukraine, it would have, quote, \u201ca week left to live.\u201d But we\u2019re not withdrawing.I know these conflicts can seem far away. And it\u2019s natural to ask: Why does this matter to America?So let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America\u2019s national security. You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don\u2019t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don\u2019t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and to the world keep rising.So, if we don\u2019t stop Putin\u2019s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won\u2019t limit himself just to Ukraine. He\u2019s\u2014Putin has already threated to \u201cremind\u201d\u2014quote, \u201cremind\u201d Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia.One of his top advisors, a former president of Russia, has called Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Russia\u2019s \u201cBaltic provinces.\u201d These are all NATO Allies.For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security. And if Putin attacks a NATO Ally, we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls for.We will have something that we do not seek\u2014make it clear: we do not seek\u2014we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia.Beyond Europe, we know that our allies and, maybe most importantly, our adversaries and competitors are watching. They\u2019re watching our response in Ukraine as well.And if we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine\u2019s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world\u2014in the Indo-Pacific, in the Middle East\u2014especially in the Middle East.Iran is\u2014is supporting Russia in Ukraine, and it\u2019s supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region. And we\u2019ll continue to hold them accountable, I might add.The United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East, one where the Middle East is more stable, better connected to its neighbors, and\u2014through innovative projects like the India-Middle East-Europe rail corridor that I announced this year at the summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies. More predictable markets, more employment, less rage, less grievances, less war when connected. It benefits the people\u2014it would benefit the people of the Middle East, and it would benefit us.American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it\u2019s just not worth it.That\u2019s why, tomorrow, I\u2019m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America\u2019s national security needs, to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine.It\u2019s a smart investment that\u2019s going to pay dividends for American security for generations, help us keep American troops out of harm\u2019s way, help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful, and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren.In Israel, we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always.The security package I\u2019m sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israel\u2019s security that will sharpen Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge, which we\u2019ve committed to\u2014the qualitative military edge.We\u2019re going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel. We\u2019re going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading.Look, at the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu and I discussed again yesterday the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war. That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can. The people of Gaza urgently need food, water, and medicine.Yesterday, in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt, I secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.If Hamas does not divert or steal this shipment\u2014these shipments, we\u2019re going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.And as I said in Israel: As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution.Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity, and peace.You know, and here at home, we have to be honest with ourselves. In recent years, too much hate has been given too much oxygen, fueling racism, a rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia right here in America.It\u2019s also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our hearts.On October 7th, terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible memories in the Jewish community.Today, Jewish families worried about being targeted in school, wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street, or going out about their daily lives.You know, I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourselves, \u201cHere we go again,\u201d with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.Just last week, a mother was brutally stabbed, a little boy\u2014here in the United States\u2014a little boy who had just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago.His name was Wadea\u2014Wadea\u2014a proud American, a proud Palestinian American family.We can\u2019t stand by and stand silent when this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.And to all of you hurting\u2014those of you who are hurting, I want you to know: I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you: You\u2019re all America. You\u2019re all America.This is in a moment where there\u2019s\u2014you know, in moments like these, when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, that we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are.We\u2019re a nation of religious freedom, freedom of expression. We all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or in our communities.And we must renounce violence and vitriol, see each other not as enemies but as\u2014but as fellow Americans.When I was in Israel yesterday, I said that when America experienced the hell of 9/11, we felt enraged as well. While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So, I cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage.And here in America, let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms\u2014all forms of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews, or anyone. That\u2019s what great nations do, and we are great nation.On Ukraine, I\u2019m asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so Ukraine can stop Putin\u2019s brutality in Ukraine.They are succeeding.When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he would take Kyiv and all of Ukraine in a matter of days. Well, over a year later, Putin has failed, and he continues to fail. Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people.Ukraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory that Russian troops once occupied, backed by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries around the world all doing its part to support Kyiv.What would happen if we walked away? We are the essential nation.Meanwhile, Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and people.From the outset, I have said I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine.All Ukraine is asking for is help\u2014for the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land, and the air defense systems to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities.And let me be clear about something: We send Ukraine equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores\u2014our own stockpiles with new equipment\u2014equipment that defends America and is made in America: Patriot missiles for air defense batteries made in Arizona; artillery shells manufactured in 12 states across the country\u2014in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas; and so much more.You know, just as in World War Two, today, patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom.Let me close with this. Earlier this year, I boarded Air Force One for a secret flight to Poland. There, I boarded a train with blacked-out windows for a 10-hour ride each way to Kyiv to stand with the people of Ukraine ahead of the one-year anniversary of their brave fight against Putin.I\u2019m told I was the first American [president] to enter a warzone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln.With me was just a small group of security personnel and a few advisors.But when I exited that train and met Zelenskyy\u2014President Zelenskyy, I didn\u2019t feel alone. I was bringing with me the idea of America, the promise of America to the people who are today fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago: freedom, independence, self-determination.And as I walked through Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, with air raid sirens sounding in the distance, I felt something I\u2019ve always believed more strongly than ever before: America is a beacon to the world still. Still.We are, as my friend Madeleine Albright said, \u201cthe indispensable nation.\u201dTonight, there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us, who believe in a better life because of us, who are desperate not be forgotten by us, and who are waiting for us.But time is of the essence.I know we have our divisions at home. We have to get past them. We can\u2019t let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation.We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen.In moments like these, we have to remind, we have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America\u2014the United States of America. And there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.My fellow Americans, thank you for your time.May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. ",

        "location": "The White House",
        "intro": "Speaking at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland, President Biden talks about the first year of the war in Ukraine after the Russian invasion. He stresses the US and European commitment to defending Ukraine and standing up for freedom and democracy around the world.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Poland! One of our great allies.\u00a0President Duda, Prime Minister \u2014 Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, and to all the former ministers and presidents, as well as mayors and Polish political leaders from all across the country: Thank you for welcoming me back to Poland. You know, it was nearly one year ago, nearly one year ago I spoke at the Royal Castle here in Warsaw, just weeks after Vladimir Putin had unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine. The largest land war in Europe since World War Two had begun. And the principles that had been the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and stability on this planet for more than 75 years were at risk of being shattered. One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv.\u00a0Well, I have just come from a visit to Kyiv, and I can report: Kyiv stands strong! Kyiv stands proud. It stands tall.\u00a0And most important, it stands free. When Russia invaded, it wasn\u2019t just Ukraine being tested.\u00a0The whole world faced a test for the ages. Europe was being tested. America was being tested.\u00a0NATO was being tested. All democracies were being tested.\u00a0And the questions we faced were as simple as they were profound. Would we respond or would we look the other way?\u00a0Would we be strong or would we be weak? Would be \u2014 we would \u2014 would we be \u2014 all of our allies \u2014 would be united or divided? One year later, we know the answer.\u00a0 We did respond. We would be strong.\u00a0We would be united. And the world would not look the other way.\u00a0 We also faced fundamental questions about the commitment to the most basic of principles.\u00a0Would we stand up for the sovereignty of nations? Would we stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression? Would we stand up for democracy? One year later, we know the answers.\u00a0 Yes, we would stand up for sovereignty.\u00a0And we did.\u00a0 Yes, we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression. And we did.\u00a0 And we would stand up for democracy. And we did. And yesterday, I had the honor to stand with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv to declare that we will keep standing up for these same things no matter what. When President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine, he thought we would roll over.\u00a0He was wrong. The Ukrainian people are too brave. America, Europe, a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific \u2014 we were too unified. Democracy was too strong. Instead of an easy victory he perceived and predicted, Putin left with burnt-out tanks and Russia\u2019s forces in delay \u2014 in disarray.\u00a0 He thought he\u2019d get the Finlandization of NATO. Instead, he got the NATOization of Finland \u2014 and Sweden.\u00a0 He thought NATO would fracture and divide. Instead, NATO is more united and more unified than ever \u2014 than ever before. He thought he could weaponize energy to crack your resolve \u2014 Europe\u2019s resolve. Instead, we\u2019re working together to end Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian fossil fuels.\u00a0 He thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracies were soft. And then, he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and force. He found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel: President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 President Putin \u2014 President Putin is confronted with something today that he didn\u2019t think was possible a year ago. The democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker. But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger. Because in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty, that knowing what you stand for is most important, and knowing who stands with you makes all the difference. The people of Poland know that.\u00a0You know that.\u00a0In fact, you know \u2014 you know it better than anyone here in Poland. Because that\u2019s what solidarity means. Through partition and oppression, when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw Uprising, during decades under the iron fist of communist rule, Poland endured because you stood together. That\u2019s how the brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their democracy. That\u2019s how the resolve of Moldovan people \u2014 (applause) \u2014 resolve of the people of Moldova to live in freedom gained them independence and put them on the path to EU membership. President Sandu is here today. I\u2019m not sure where she is. But I\u2019m proud to stand with you and the freedom-loving people of Moldova.\u00a0Give her a round of applause. One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition. But he still doubts our conviction. He doubts our staying power.\u00a0He doubts our continued support for Ukraine. He doubts whether NATO can remain unified. But there should be no doubt: Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire.\u00a0 President Putin\u2019s craven lust for land and power will fail.\u00a0And the Ukrainian people\u2019s love for their country will prevail. Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow, and forever.\u00a0For that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here: freedom. That\u2019s the message I carried to Kyiv yesterday, directly to the people of Ukraine. When President Zelenskyy said \u2014 he came to the United States in December \u2014 quote \u2014 he said this struggle will define the world and what our children and grandchildren \u2014 how they live, and then their children and grandchildren. He wasn\u2019t only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine. He was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren.\u00a0Yours and mine. We\u2019re seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people all across Europe saw for decades: Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.\u00a0They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand one word: \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, you will not take my country.\u201d \u201cNo, you will not take my freedom.\u201d \u201cNo, you will not take my future.\u201d And I\u2019ll repeat tonight what I said last year in this same place: A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to erase the people\u2019s love of liberty. Brutality will never grind down the will of the free. And Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never.\u00a0 For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. You know, this has been an extraordinary year in every sense. Extraordinary brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries. They have committed depravities, crimes against humanity, without shame or compunction.\u00a0They\u2019ve targeted civilians with death and destruction.\u00a0Used rape as a weapon of war.\u00a0Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to \u2014 in an attempt to steal Ukraine\u2019s future. Bombed train stations, maternity hospitals, schools, and orphanages. No one \u2014 no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people. It\u2019s abhorrent. It\u2019s abhorrent. But extraordinarily, as well, has been the response of the Ukrainian people and the world. One year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Ukraine is still independent and free. From Kherson to Kharkiv, Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their land. In more than 50 percent of the territory Russia held last year, the blue and the yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once again. President Zelenskyy still leads a democratically elected government that represents the will of the Ukrainian people. And the world has already voted multiple times, including in the United Nations General Assembly, to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression and support a just peace. Each time in the U.N., that vote has been overwhelming. In October, 143 nations in the United Nations condemned Russia\u2019s illegal annexation. Only four \u2014 four in the entire U.N. \u2014 voted with Russia. Four. So, tonight, I speak once more to the people of Russia. The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia.\u00a0The West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today. And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy. This war was never a necessity; it\u2019s a tragedy.\u00a0\u00a0 President Putin chose this war.\u00a0Every day the war continues is his choice. He could end the war with a word. It\u2019s simple. If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia, it would be the end of Ukraine. That\u2019s why, together, we\u2019re making sure Ukraine can defend itself. The United States has assembled a worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations to get critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines. Air defense systems, artillery, ammunition, tanks, and armored vehicles. The European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented commitment to Ukraine, not just in security assistance, but economic, and humanitarian, refugee assistance, and so much more.\u00a0 To all of you here tonight: Take a moment. And I\u2019m serious when I say this: Turn on and look \u2014 turn around and look at one another. Look at what you\u2019ve done so far. Poland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. God bless you.\u00a0\u00a0 Poland\u2019s generosity, your willingness to open your hearts and your homes, is extraordinary. And the American people are united in our resolve as well. All across my country, in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes.\u00a0 Over the past year, Democrats and Republicans in our United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom. That\u2019s who Americans are, and that\u2019s what Americans do.\u00a0 The world is also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putin\u2019s war. Putin tried to starve the world, blocking the ports in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting its grain, exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially hard. Instead, the United States and the G7 and partners around the world answered the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster global food supplies. And this week, my wife, Jill Biden, is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issue. Our commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine \u2014 a Ukraine that\u2019s free, sovereign, and democratic. That was the dream of those who declared Ukraine\u2019s independence more than 30 years ago \u2014 who led the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity; who braved ice and fire on the Maidan and the Heavenly Hundred who died there; and those who continue still to root out Kremlin\u2019s efforts to corrupt, coerce, and control. It\u2019s a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who have fought for years against Russia\u2019s aggressions in the Donbas and the heroes who have given everything, given their lives, in the service of their beloved Ukraine. I was honored to visit their memorial in Kyiv yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lost their lives, standing alongside President Zelenskyy. The United States and our partners stand with Ukraine\u2019s teachers, its hospital staff, its emergency responders, the workers in cities across Ukraine who are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russia\u2019s cruel bombardment. We stand with the millions of refugees of this war who have found a welcome in Europe and the United States, particularly here in Poland. Ordinary people all across Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so.\u00a0Polish businesses, civil society, cultural leaders \u2014 including the First Lady of Poland, who is here tonight \u2014 have led with the heart and determination, showcasing all that\u2019s good about the human spirit. Madam First Lady, we love you.\u00a0 Thank you all.\u00a0 I\u2019ll never forget, last year, visiting with refugees from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw, seeing their faces exhausted and afraid \u2014 holding their children so close, worrying they might never see their fathers, their husbands, their brothers or sisters again. In that darkest moment of their lives, you, the people of Poland, offered them safety and light.\u00a0You embraced them.\u00a0You literally embraced them.\u00a0I watched.\u00a0I watched the looks on their faces.\u00a0 Meanwhile, together we have made sure that Russia is paying the price for its abuses. We continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country in history.\u00a0And we\u2019re going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partners. We\u2019ll hold accountable those who are responsible for this war. And we will seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the Russians. You know, there is much for us to be proud of over the \u2014 all that we have achieved together this past year.\u00a0But we have to be honest and cleared-eyed as we look at the year ahead. The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year.\u00a0It\u2019s always difficult.\u00a0It\u2019s always important. As Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught and launch counter-offensives of its own, there will continue to be hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies.\u00a0But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead.\u00a0And the United States, together with our Allies and partners, are going to continue to have Ukraine\u2019s back as it defends itself. Next year, I will host every member of NATO for our 2024 summit in the United States.\u00a0Together, we\u2019ll celebrate the 75th anniversary of the strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world \u2014 NATO.\u00a0 And let there be no doubt, the commitment of the United States to our NATO Alliance and Article 5 is rock solid.\u00a0And every member of NATO knows it. And Russia knows it as well. An attack against one is an attack against all.\u00a0It\u2019s a sacred oath.\u00a0A sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory. Over the past year, the United States has come together with our Allies and partners in an extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggression. But the work in front of us is not just what we\u2019re against, it\u2019s about what we\u2019re for.\u00a0What kind of world do we want to build? We need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lifting up \u2014 lifting up the lives of people everywhere, improving health, growing prosperity, preserving the planet, building peace and security, treating everyone with dignity and respect. That\u2019s our responsibility. The democracies of the world have to deliver it for our people. As we gather tonight, the world, in my view, is at an \u2014 at an inflection point. The decisions we make over the next five years or so are going to determine and shape our lives for decades to come. That\u2019s true for Americans.\u00a0It\u2019s true for the people of the world. And while decisions are ours to make now, the principles and the stakes are eternal. A choice between chaos and stability.\u00a0Between building and destroying. Between hope and fear. Between democracy that lifts up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crushes it.\u00a0Between nothing less than limitation and possibilities, the kind of possibilities that come when people who live not in captivity but in freedom. Freedom. Freedom. There is no sweeter word than freedom.\u00a0There is no nobler goal than freedom.\u00a0There is no higher aspiration than freedom. Americans know that, and you know it. And all that we do now must be done so our children and grandchildren will know it as well. Freedom. The enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the ages. Freedom. Stand with us. We will stand with you. Let us move forward with faith and conviction and with an abiding commitment to be allies not of darkness, but of light.\u00a0Not of oppression, but of liberation.\u00a0Not of captivity, but, yes, of freedom. May God bless you all.\u00a0May God protect our troops. And may God bless the heroes of Ukraine and all those who defend freedom around the world. Thank you, Poland.\u00a0Thank you, thank you, thank you for what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0God bless you all. ",

        "intro": "In his State of the Union Address, President Joe Biden focuses on the improving US economy and the projects that are moving forward because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. He talks about \"finishing the job\" on many of the efforts he began during his administration, such as lowering prices on prescription drugs, giving access to health care to more Americans, tackling climate change, and making the tax system fair. He also urges Congress to ban assault weapons, raise the debt ceiling, and stop the surge of fentanyl in America. He ends his speech, noting that \"I have never been more optimistic about the future of America.\"\n",
        "transcript": " Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military. Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court. And you, my fellow Americans. I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together. I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries. Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell. And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority. And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi. The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up. A story that is unique among all nations. We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it. That is what we are doing again. Two years ago, our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities. You know, we\u2019re often told that Democrats and Republicans can\u2019t work together. But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together. Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe. Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people. Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together in this new Congress. The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere. And that\u2019s always been my vision for our country. To restore the soul of the nation. To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. To unite the country. We\u2019ve been sent here to finish the job. For decades, the middle class was hollowed out. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be. And along the way, something else was lost. Pride. That sense of self-worth. I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \u201cHoney\u2014it\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d and mean it. So, let\u2019s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We\u2019ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. Where is it written that America can\u2019t lead the world in manufacturing again? For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs. Now, thanks to all we\u2019ve done, we\u2019re exporting American products and creating American jobs. Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin\u2019s war that disrupted energy and food supplies. But we\u2019re better positioned than any country on Earth. We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak. Food inflation is coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up. Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business. Every time somebody starts a small business, it\u2019s an act of hope. And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted. Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility. Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America. America used to make nearly 40% of the world\u2019s chips. But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we\u2019re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down. Today\u2019s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn\u2019t make enough cars because there weren\u2019t enough chips. Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones. We can never let that happen again. That\u2019s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. We\u2019re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America. We\u2019ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law. With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country. That\u2019s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years. Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres \u2013 a literal field of dreams. That\u2019ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished. Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don\u2019t require a college degree. Jobs where people don\u2019t have to leave home in search of opportunity. And it\u2019s just getting started. Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life. Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they\u2019ll tell you what this means to their communities. We\u2019re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland. But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world. We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th. Now we\u2019re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower\u2019s Interstate Highway System. Already, we\u2019ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland. These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America. Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal. And we\u2019re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law. And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don\u2019t worry. I promised to be the president for all Americans. We\u2019ll fund your projects. And I\u2019ll see you at the ground-breaking. This law will help further unite all of America. Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs. One of the nation\u2019s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we\u2019re finally going to get it done. I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project. While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight. For 30 years, she\u2019s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the \u201ccowboys of the sky\u201d who built the Cincinnati skyline. Sara said she can\u2019t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That\u2019s pride. That\u2019s what we\u2019re also building\u2014Pride. We\u2019re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water. We\u2019re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet. No parent should have to drive to a McDonald\u2019s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online. And when we do these projects, we\u2019re going to Buy American. Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it. Not anymore. Tonight, I\u2019m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America. American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables. And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products. My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you, watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives. For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you. Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house? I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we\u2019re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night. You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth. For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes. Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make. But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars\u2014and making record profits. Not anymore. We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. Let\u2019s finish the job this time. Let\u2019s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it. This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year. If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference. And we\u2019re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn\u2019t just save seniors money. It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare. Why wouldn\u2019t we want to do that? Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it. I\u2019m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history. A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums. But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025. Let\u2019s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid. Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis. Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future. I\u2019ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms, and wildfires. In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term. New electric grids able to weather the next major storm. Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood. Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind. We\u2019re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers. And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances. Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands. Let\u2019s face reality. The climate crisis doesn\u2019t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat. We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I\u2019m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge. But there\u2019s so much more to do. We will finish the job. And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. I\u2019m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share. And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair. The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes? That\u2019s simply not fair. But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%. Just 15%. That\u2019s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes. Nobody. Not one penny. But there\u2019s more to do. Let\u2019s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax. Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter. You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits. Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis. It\u2019s outrageous. They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down. Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders. Corporations ought to do the right thing. That\u2019s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead. They will still make a considerable profit. Let\u2019s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes. Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That\u2019s being fiscally responsible. In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion\u2014the largest deficit reduction in American history. Under the previous administration, America\u2019s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor. Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone. How did Congress respond to all that debt? They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis. They paid America\u2019s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country. Tonight, I\u2019m asking this Congress to follow suit. Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned. Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years. That means if Congress doesn\u2019t vote to keep them, those programs will go away. Other Republicans say if we don\u2019t cut Social Security and Medicare, they\u2019ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history. I won\u2019t let that happen. Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors. Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working. So tonight, let\u2019s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare. Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them. If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them. I will not allow them to be taken away. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan. We can sit down together and discuss both plans together. My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion. I won\u2019t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit. In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades. I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I\u2019ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share. Look, here\u2019s the deal. Big corporations aren\u2019t just taking advantage of the tax code. They\u2019re taking advantage of you, the American consumer. Here\u2019s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We\u2019re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month. We\u2019re protecting seniors\u2019 lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don\u2019t need. Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription. Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation. Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country. I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers. Let\u2019s finish the job. Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage. My administration is also taking on \u201cjunk\u201d fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more. For example, we\u2019re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed. We\u2019ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year. We\u2019re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8. Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip. I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore. We\u2019ve written a bill to stop all that. It\u2019s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act. We\u2019ll ban surprise \u201cresort fees\u201d that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren\u2019t even resorts. We\u2019ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider. We\u2019ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront. And we\u2019ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough\u2014they can\u2019t just treat your child like a piece of luggage. Americans are tired of being played for suckers. Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off. For too long, workers have been getting stiffed. Not anymore. We\u2019re beginning to restore the dignity of work. For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can\u2019t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more. Not anymore. We\u2019re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they\u2019re worth. I\u2019m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing. Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let\u2019s guarantee all workers a living wage. Let\u2019s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work. Let\u2019s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history. And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth. Let\u2019s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing. Let\u2019s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones. Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God\u2019s work. These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them. Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world. But the world has caught up. Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: \u201cAny nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.\u201d Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century. If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let\u2019s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds. Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background. Let\u2019s give public school teachers a raise. And we\u2019re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families. Let\u2019s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree. Let\u2019s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not. And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let\u2019s also recognize how far we\u2019ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself. While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID\u2019s grip on us. COVID deaths are down nearly 90%. We\u2019ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up. And soon we\u2019ll end the public health emergency. But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID. Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant. We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe. And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I\u2019m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic. Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant. Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we\u2019ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, let\u2019s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people. For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much. COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe. Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated. Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child. But imagine what it\u2019s like to lose a child at the hands of the law. Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car. I\u2019ve never had to have the talk with my children\u2014Beau, Hunter, and Ashley\u2014that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children. If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don\u2019t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Imagine having to worry like that every day in America. Here\u2019s what Tyre\u2019s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out. With faith in God, she said her son \u201cwas a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.\u201d Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It\u2019s up to us. It\u2019s up to all of us. We all want the same thing. Neighborhoods free of violence. Law enforcement who earn the community\u2019s trust. Our children to come home safely. Equal protection under the law; that\u2019s the covenant we have with each other in America. And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much. To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more. We ask too much of them. I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield. But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe. We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges. More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training. All this can help prevent violence in the first place. And when police officers or departments violate the public\u2019s trust, we must hold them accountable. With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act. Let\u2019s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre\u2019s mother come true, something good must come from this. All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment. We can\u2019t turn away. Let\u2019s do what we know in our hearts we need to do. Let\u2019s come together and finish the job on police reform. Do something. That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence. Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades. That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others. But we know our work is not done. Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero. Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom\u2019s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents. Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio\u2019s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him. He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside. In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio. He saved lives. It\u2019s time we do the same as well. Ban assault weapons once and for all. We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994. In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled. Let\u2019s finish the job and ban assault weapons again. And let\u2019s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before. We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months. Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%. But America\u2019s border problems won\u2019t be fixed until Congress acts. If you won\u2019t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. Here in the people\u2019s House, it\u2019s our duty to protect all the people\u2019s rights and freedoms. Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman\u2019s constitutional right to choose. The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans. Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it. Let\u2019s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity. Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let\u2019s remember the world is watching. I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine. A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II. Putin\u2019s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy? For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer. Yes, we would. And yes, we did. Together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO and built a global coalition. We stood against Putin\u2019s aggression. We stood with the Ukrainian people. Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people. Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes. Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere. Before I came to office, the story was about how the People\u2019s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world. Not anymore. I\u2019ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict. I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China\u2019s government is intent on dominating. Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they\u2019re not used against us. Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression. Today, we\u2019re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world. I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China\u2019s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did. And let\u2019s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world. But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker. Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger. America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression. Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more. And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are. It\u2019s never a good bet to bet against America. When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it. That\u2019s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation. We\u2019ve made real progress. Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction. Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health. Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and so much more. We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year. But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together. Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire. He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister\u2019s best friend. He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans. Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose. She was 20 years old. Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, \u201cThere is no worse pain.\u201d Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws. He told us he wants to \u201cstart the journey towards America\u2019s recovery.\u201d Doug, we\u2019re with you. Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year. Let\u2019s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border. Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Second, let\u2019s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school. We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit. And it\u2019s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us. Third, let\u2019s do more to keep our nation\u2019s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm\u2019s way and care for them and their families when they come home. Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life. Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it. And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide. The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they\u2019re going through and get the help they need. And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families. It\u2019s personal for so many of us. Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama. They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did. Kindred spirits. He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava. She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer. 26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed. A 5% survival rate. He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, \u201cif she goes, I can\u2019t stay.\u201d Jill and I understand, like so many of you. They read how Jill described our family\u2019s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can. For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything. They never gave up hope. Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month. They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she\u2019s watching from the White House tonight. For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things. Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It\u2019s been a huge success. I believe we can do the same with cancer. Let\u2019s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all. There\u2019s one reason why we\u2019re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself. It\u2019s the most fundamental thing of all. With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is. For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk. Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th. And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th. Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get. My friend, Paul Pelosi. But such a heinous act never should have happened. We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy. And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor. Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue. Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it. And this is our moment. My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come. We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand. We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking. A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos. We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea. That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities. So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report. Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong. As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. ",

        "date": "September 21, 2022",
        "location": "The White House",
        "intro": "President Joe Biden addresses the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. He speaks out against Russia and its invasion of Ukraine, and he calls for a recommitment to the UN charter and its principles. He also recounts the threat to the world from climate change and outlines steps to thwart its effects. He ends by committing the United States to human rights and the values of the UN, commenting that the UN is \"at its core, an act of dauntless hope.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, my fellow leaders, in the last year, our world has experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods, and droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war\u2014a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt.\u00a0 Let us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map.\u00a0 Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter\u2014no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force.\u00a0 Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime.\u00a0 Now Russia is calling\u2014calling up more soldiers to join the fight. And the Kremlin is organizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter.\u00a0 This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened. But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict.\u00a0 In fact, we warned it was coming. And with many of you, we worked to try to avert it. Putin\u2019s own words make his true purpose unmistakable. Just before he invaded, Putin asserted\u2014and I quote\u2014Ukraine was \u201ccreated by Russia\u201d and never had, quote, \u201creal statehood.\u201d And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals, wa-\u2014on centers of Ukrainian history and culture.\u00a0 In the past, even more horrifying evidence of Russia\u2019s atrocity and war crimes: mass graves uncovered in Izyum; bodies, according to those that excavated those bodies, showing signs of torture.\u00a0 This war is about extinguishing Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not\u2014that should make your blood run cold. That\u2019s why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. The United States has marshaled massive levels of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine\u2014more than $25 billion to date.\u00a0 Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well. And today, more than 40 countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself.\u00a0 The United States is also working closely with our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, to deter attacks against NATO territory, to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes. Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for. Everything. Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers. But this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate.\u00a0 We chose liberty. We chose sovereignty. We chose principles to which every party to the United Nations Charter is beholding. We stood with Ukraine. Like you, the United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we all signed up for: that you cannot seize a nation\u2019s territory by force. The only country standing in the way of that is Russia.\u00a0 So, we\u2014each of us in this body who is determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as members of the United Nations\u2014must be clear, firm, and unwavering in our resolve.\u00a0 Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia\u2019s aggression. Period. Now, it\u2019s no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States\u2014and I, as President\u2014champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy.\u00a0 The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world. Because I believe democracy remains humanity\u2019s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the G7 and likeminded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their citizens but also deliver for the rest of the world as well.\u00a0 But as we meet today, the U.N. Charter\u2014the U.N. Charter\u2019s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage.\u00a0 And the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, it was negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to work for peace.\u00a0 As President Truman said in 1945, the U.N. Charter\u2014and I quote\u2014is \u201cproof that nations, like men, can state their differences, can face them, and then can find common ground on which to stand.\u201d End of quote. That common ground was so straightforward, so basic that, today, 193 of you\u2014193 member states\u2014have willingly embraced its principles. And standing up for those principles for the U.N. Charter is the job of every responsible member state.\u00a0 I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed. To stand against global politics of fear and coercion; to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones; to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation, respect for international law, and arms control\u2014no matter what else we may disagree on, that is the common ground upon which we must stand.\u00a0 If you\u2019re still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world, then the United States wants to work with you.\u00a0 I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today\u2019s world. Members of the U.N. Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the U.N. Charter and refrain\u2014refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective. That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council. This includes permanent seats for those nations we\u2019ve long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The United States is committed to this vital work. In every region, we pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests, from elevating the Quad in the Indo-Pacific; to signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas; to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful, integrated Middle East; to hosting the U.S.-Africa Leaders\u2019 Summit in\u2014this December. As I said last year, the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people\u2019s lives\u2014all people\u2019s lives: tackling the climate crisis, as the previous speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; feeding the world\u2014feeding the world. We made that priority. And one year later, we\u2019re keeping that promise. From the day I came to office, we\u2019ve led with a bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on COP26. And we helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 And now I\u2019ve signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion toward climate change. That includes tens of billions in new investments in offshore wind and solar, doubling down on zero emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency, supporting clean manufacturing. Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce U.S. emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030 while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth. Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies worldwide, not just the United States. This is a global gamechanger\u2014and none too soon. We don\u2019t have much time. We all know we\u2019re already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. As we meet, much of Pakistan is still underwater; it needs help. Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought.\u00a0 Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they\u2019ll survive. This is the human cost of climate change. And it\u2019s growing, not lessening. So, as I announced last year, to meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance to help lower-income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition. The key part of that will be our PREPARE plan, which will help half a billion people, and especially vulnerable countries, adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience. This need is enormous. So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable, clean energy economy to preserve our planet. On global health, we\u2019ve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries\u2019 needs\u2014all free of charge, no strings attached. And we\u2019re working closely with the G20 and other countries. And the United States helped lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response at the World Bank. At the same time, we\u2019ve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges. Later today, I\u2019ll host the Seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort. So I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history. We\u2019re also taking on the food crisis head on. With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acute\u2014acute food insecurity\u2014a jump of 40 million in a year\u2014today I\u2019m announcing another $2.9 billion in U.S. support for lifesaving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone. Russia, in the meantime, is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the crisis\u2014the food crisis\u2014onto sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0 So let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow\u2014explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer. No limitation. It\u2019s Russia\u2019s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it. I\u2019m grateful for the work here at the U.N.\u2014including your leadership, Mr. Secretary-General\u2014establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months, and we need to make sure it\u2019s extended. We believe strongly in the need to feed the world. That\u2019s why the United States is the world\u2019s largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 percent of its budget. We\u2019re leading support\u2014we\u2019re leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around the world.\u00a0 And to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced a Call to Action: a roadmap eliminating global food insecurity\u2014to eliminating global food insecurity that more than 100 nation member states have already supported. In June, the G7 announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world. Through USAID\u2019s Feed the Future initiative, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less. And we\u2019re calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering. Because in every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing\u2014nothing else matters if parents cannot feed their children. As we look to the future, we\u2019re working with our partners to update and create rules of the road for new challenges we face in the 21st century. We launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key technologies\u2014key technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone.\u00a0 With our partner countries and through the U.N., we\u2019re supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility\u2014responsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security.\u00a0 With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, we\u2019re working to build a new economic ecosystem while\u2014where every nation\u2014every nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable, and shared.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the United States has championed a global minimum tax. And we will work to see it implemented so major corporations pay their fair share everywhere\u2014everywhere. It\u2019s also been the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies. We\u2019re working with our partners in ASEAN and the Pacific Islands to support a vision for a critical Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient. Together with partners around the world, we\u2019re working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon. And as Russia\u2019s war rolls the global economy, we\u2019re also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower-income countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world.\u00a0 Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let\u2019s meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments\u2014high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment\u2014keyed to the needs of the communities they serve, not to the contributor. That\u2019s why the United States, together with fellow G7 partners, launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion in investment through this partnership by 2027.\u00a0 Dozens of projects are already underway: industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola, first-of-its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania. These are investments that are going to deliver returns not just for those countries, but for everyone. The United States will work with every nation, including our competitors, to solve global problems like climate change. Climate diplomacy is not a favor to the United States or any other nation, and walking away hurts the entire world. Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China. As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a Cold War. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.\u00a0 But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations: investments that are designed not to foster dependency, but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient; partnerships not to create political obligation, but because we know our own success\u2014each of our success is increased when other nations succeed as well. When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits. Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution: increasing peace and security for everyone, everywhere.\u00a0 The United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world. And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflicts.\u00a0 We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.\u00a0 We remain committed to our One China policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades. And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.\u00a0 We support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people.\u00a0 In Venezuela, where years of the political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country, we urge a Venezuelan-led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections. We continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces political-fueled gang violence and an enormous human crisis. And we call on the world to do the same. We have more to do.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to back the U.N.-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people that have suffered years of war. And we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiating peace between the Jewish and democratic state of Israel and the Palestinian people. The United States is committed to Israel\u2019s security, full stop. And a negotiated two-state solution remains, in our view, the best way to ensure Israel\u2019s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state which\u2014to which they are entitled\u2014both sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens; both people enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignity. Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime through diplomacy. No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures. A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u00a0 The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January. But today, we\u2019re seeing disturbing trends. Russia shunned the Non-Proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference.\u00a0 And again, today, as I said, they\u2019re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons. China is conducting an unprecedented, concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency.\u00a0 Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions. And while the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. The nonproliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution. We cannot let the world now slide backwards, nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights. Perhaps singular among this body\u2019s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves. They made clear in 1948: Human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve. And yet today, in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations of\u2014in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports by the Office of U.N.\u2014U.S.\u2014reports detailing by the U.S. [U.N.] High Commissioner, to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma, to the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan. And today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights. But here\u2019s what I know: The future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient societies; where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities; where the LGBTQ+ community individuals live and love freely without being targeted with violence; where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal. The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter in our own country and around the world. Let me end with this: This institution, guided by the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope. Let me say that again: It\u2019s an act of dauntless hope. Think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smoldering. Think about how divided the people of the world must have felt with the fresh grief of millions dead, the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed. They had every right to believe only the worst of humanity. Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us, and they strove to build something better: enduring peace; comity among nations; equal rights for every member of the human family; cooperation for the advancement of all humankind. My fellow leaders, the challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater. Our commitment must be greater still. So let\u2019s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the U.N. Charter, that we still believe by working together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it. We\u2019re not passive witnesses to history; we are the authors of history. We can do this\u2014we have to do it\u2014for ourselves and for our future, for humankind. Thank you for your tolerance, for listening to me. I appreciate it very much. God bless you all.\u00a0 ",

        "intro": "President Joe Biden speaks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, about the state of American democracy. He warns against threats from former President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans, who are unwilling to admit defeat in the 2020 election and threaten political violence if they do not get their way. Biden stresses the tenets of US democracy such as the rule of law, free and fair elections, and liberty and justice for all.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, please, if you have a seat, take it. I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America: Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \u00a0 This is where America made its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two centuries ago with an idea, unique among nations, that in America, we\u2019re all created equal. \u00a0 This is where the United States Constitution was written and debated. \u00a0 This is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self-government the world has ever known with three simple words: \u201cWe, the People.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe, the People.\u201d \u00a0 These two documents and the ideas they embody\u2014equality and democracy\u2014are the rock upon which this nation is built.\u00a0They are how we became the greatest nation on Earth. They are why, for more than two centuries, America has been a beacon to the world. \u00a0 But as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault.\u00a0We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise. \u00a0 So tonight, I have come this place where it all began to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threats we face, about the power we have in our own hands to meet these threats, and about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it. \u00a0 We must never forget: We, the people, are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago. \u00a0 We, the people, have burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall\u2014a flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, Suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, Civil Rights. \u00a0 That sacred flame still burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just. \u00a0 That is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul. \u00a0 But first, we must be honest with each other and with ourselves.\u00a0 \u00a0 Too much of what\u2019s happening in our country today is not normal. \u00a0 Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. \u00a0 Now, I want to be very clear\u2014very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. \u00a0 I know because I\u2019ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. \u00a0 But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country. \u00a0 These are hard things.\u00a0 \u00a0 But I\u2019m an American President\u2014not the President of red America or blue America, but of all America. \u00a0 And I believe it is my duty\u2014my duty to level with you, to tell the truth no matter how difficult, no matter how painful. \u00a0 And here, in my view, is what is true: MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution.\u00a0They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people.\u00a0 \u00a0 They refuse to accept the results of a free election.\u00a0And they\u2019re working right now, as I speak, in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself. \u00a0 MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards\u2014backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love. \u00a0 They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country. \u00a0 They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th\u2014brutally attacking law enforcement\u2014not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots. \u00a0 And they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. \u00a0 They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people.\u00a0This time, they\u2019re determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people. \u00a0 That\u2019s why respected conservatives, like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig, has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans, quote, a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to our democracy. \u00a0 But while the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can: We are not powerless in the face of these threats.\u00a0We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy. \u00a0 There are far more Americans\u2014far more Americans from every\u2014from every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it.\u00a0 \u00a0 And, folks, it is within our power, it\u2019s in our hands\u2014yours and mine\u2014to stop the assault on American democracy. \u00a0 I believe America is at an inflection point\u2014one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that\u2019s to come after. \u00a0 And now America must choose: to move forward or to move backwards?\u00a0To build the future or obsess about the past?\u00a0To be a nation of hope and unity and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness? \u00a0 MAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies. \u00a0 But together\u2014together, we can choose a different path. We can choose a better path.\u00a0Forward, to the future. A future of possibility. A future to build and dream and hope. \u00a0 And we\u2019re on that path, moving ahead. \u00a0 I know this nation. I know you, the American people. I know your courage. I know your hearts. And I know our history. \u00a0 This is a nation that honors our Constitution. We do not reject it.\u00a0 \u00a0 This is a nation that believes in the rule of law. We do not repudiate it.\u00a0 This is a nation that respects free and fair elections. We honor the will of the people.\u00a0We do not deny it.\u00a0 \u00a0 And this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool. We do not encourage violence. \u00a0 We are still an America that believes in honesty and decency and respect for others, patriotism, liberty, justice for all, hope, possibilities.\u00a0 \u00a0 We are still, at our core, a democracy.\u00a0 And yet history tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy. \u00a0 For a long time, we\u2019ve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it\u2019s not. \u00a0 We have to defend it, protect it, stand up for it\u2014each and every one of us. That\u2019s why tonight I\u2019m asking our nation to come together, unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\u00a0 We\u2019re all called, by duty and conscience, to confront extremists who will put their own pursuit of power above all else.\u00a0 \u00a0 Democrats, independents, mainstream Republicans: We must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving American democracy than MAGA Republicans are to\u2014to destroying American democracy.\u00a0 \u00a0 We, the people, will not let anyone or anything tear us apart. Today, there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail.\u00a0 We hear\u2014you\u2019ve heard it\u2014more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It\u2019s not. It can never be an acceptable tool.\u00a0 \u00a0 So I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America. Period. None. Ever.\u00a0 We saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th.\u00a0We\u2019ve seen election officials, poll workers\u2014many of them volunteers of both parties\u2014subjected to intimidation and death threats. And\u2014can you believe it?\u2014FBI agents just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens.\u00a0 \u00a0 On top of that, there are public figures\u2014today, yesterday, and the day before\u2014predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets. This is inflammatory. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s against the rule of law. And we, the people, must say: This is not who we are.\u00a0 \u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, we can\u2019t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They\u2019re incompatible.\u00a0 We can\u2019t allow violence to be normalized in this country. It\u2019s wrong.\u00a0We each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster. Now. \u00a0 We can\u2019t let the integrity of our elections be undermined, for that is a path to chaos.\u00a0 \u00a0 Look, I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America. I get it. I believe in the give-and-take of politics, in disagreement and debate and dissent. \u00a0 We\u2019re a big, complicated country. But democracy endures only if we, the people, respect the guardrails of the republic. Only if we, the people, accept the results of free and fair elections.\u00a0Only if we, the people, see politics not as total war but mediation of our differences.\u00a0 \u00a0 Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: either they win or they were cheated.\u00a0And that\u2019s where MAGA Republicans are today.\u00a0 \u00a0 They don\u2019t understand what every patriotic American knows: You can\u2019t love your country only when you win.\u00a0It\u2019s fundamental.\u00a0 \u00a0 American democracy only works only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institutions that were set up in this chamber behind me, only if we respect our legitimate political differences.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 I will not stand by and watch\u2014I will not\u2014the will of the American people be overturned by wild conspiracy theories and baseless, evidence-free claims of fraud.\u00a0 \u00a0 I will not stand by and watch elections in this country stolen by people who simply refuse to accept that they lost.\u00a0 \u00a0 I will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this country\u2014the freedom to vote and have your vote counted\u2014and\u2014be taken from you and the American people.\u00a0 \u00a0 Look, as your President, I will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being, and I\u2019m asking every American to join me.\u00a0 \u00a0 Throughout our history, America has often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments, like you\u2019re hearing in that bullhorn.\u00a0 \u00a0 I believe we can and we must do that again, and we are.\u00a0 \u00a0 MAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair. They spread fear and lies\u2013-lies told for profit and power.\u00a0 \u00a0 But I see a very different America\u2014an America with an unlimited future, an America that is about to take off. I hope you see it as well.\u00a0 Just look around. \u00a0 I believed we could lift America from the depths of COVID, so we passed the largest economic recovery package since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And today, America\u2019s economy is faster, stronger than any other advanced nation in the world.\u00a0We have more to go. \u00a0 I believed we could build a better America, so we passed the biggest infrastructure investment since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And we\u2019ve now embarked on a decade of rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, highways, ports, water systems, high-speed Internet, railroads.\u00a0 \u00a0 I believed we could make America safer, so we passed the most significant gun safety law since President Clinton.\u00a0 \u00a0 I believed we could go from being the highest cost of prescriptions in the world to making prescription drugs and healthcare more affordable, so we passed the most significant healthcare reforms since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 \u00a0 And I believed we could create\u2014we could create a clean energy future and save the planet, so we passed the most important climate initiative ever, ever, ever.\u00a0 \u00a0 The cynics and the critics tell us nothing can get done, but they are wrong. There is not a single thing America cannot do\u2014not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together. \u00a0 It\u2019s never easy. But we\u2019re proving that in America, no matter how long the road, progress does come.\u00a0 \u00a0 Look, I know the last year\u2014few years have been tough. But today, COVID no longer controls our lives.\u00a0More Americans are working than ever. Businesses are growing. Our schools are open.\u00a0Millions of Americans have been lifted out of poverty. Millions of veterans once exposed to toxic burn pits will now get what they deserve for their families and the compensation.\u00a0 \u00a0 American manufacturing has come alive across the Heartland, and the future will be made in America\u2014no matter what the white supremacists and the extremists say.\u00a0 \u00a0 I made a bet on you, the American people, and that bet is paying off.\u00a0Proving that from darkness \u2014the darkness of Charlottesville, of COVID, of gun violence, of insurrection\u2014we can see the light. Light is now visible.\u00a0 \u00a0 Light that will guide us forward not only in words, but in actions\u2014actions for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, for America. \u00a0 Even in this moment, with all the challenges we face, I give you my word as a Biden: I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about America\u2019s future.\u00a0Not because of me, but because of who you are. \u00a0 We\u2019re going to end cancer as we know it.\u00a0Mark my words.\u00a0 \u00a0 We are going to create millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy. \u00a0 We\u2019re going to think big.\u00a0We\u2019re going to make the 21st century another American century because the world needs us to.\u00a0 \u00a0 That\u2019s where we need to focus our energy\u2014not in the past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance, but on a future we can build together. \u00a0 The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail.\u00a0They believe America\u2014not like I believe about America.\u00a0 \u00a0 I believe America is big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the nation we\u2019re building: a nation where no one is left behind. \u00a0 I ran for President because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life, and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us \u201cus.\u201d \u00a0 The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God. That all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity, and respect. That all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence.\u00a0And that democracy\u2014democracy must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible.\u00a0Folks, and it\u2019s up to us. \u00a0 Democracy begins and will be preserved in we, the people\u2019s, habits of heart, in our character: optimism that is tested yet endures, courage that digs deep when we need it, empathy that fuels democracy, the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans. Look, our democracy is imperfect. It always has been. \u00a0 Notwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there. They\u2019re entitled to be outrageous.\u00a0This is a democracy.\u00a0But history and common sense\u2014good manners is nothing they\u2019ve ever suffered from.\u00a0 \u00a0 But history and common sense tell us that opportunity, liberty, and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy. \u00a0 We have never fully realized the aspirations of our founding, but every generation has opened those doors a little wider to include more people who have been excluded before. \u00a0 My fellow Americans, America is an idea\u2014the most powerful idea in the history of the world.\u00a0And it beats in the hearts of the people of this country.\u00a0It beats in all of our hearts. It unites America. It is the American creed. \u00a0 The idea that America guarantees that everyone be treated with dignity. It gives hate no safe harbor.\u00a0It installs in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t achieve. \u00a0 That\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what we stand for. That\u2019s what we believe.\u00a0And that is precisely what we are doing: opening doors, creating new possibilities, focusing on the future. And we\u2019re only just beginning.\u00a0 \u00a0 Our task is to make our nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole. \u00a0 And this work is the work of democracy\u2014the work of this generation. It is the work of our time, for all time. \u00a0 We can\u2019t afford to have\u2014leave anyone on the sidelines.\u00a0We need everyone to do their part. So speak up.\u00a0Speak out. Get engaged.\u00a0Vote, vote, vote.\u00a0 And if we all do our duty\u2014if we do our duty in 2022 and beyond, then ages still to come will say we\u2014all of us here\u2014we kept the faith. We preserved democracy. We heeded not our worst instincts but our better angels.\u00a0And we proved that, for all its imperfections, America is still the beacon to the world, an ideal to be realized, a promise to be kept. \u00a0 There is nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American.\u00a0That\u2019s our soul.\u00a0That\u2019s who we truly are. And that\u2019s who must\u2014we must always be. \u00a0 And I have no doubt\u2014none\u2013\u2013that this is who we will be and that we\u2019ll come together as a nation.\u00a0That we\u2019ll secure our democracy. That for the next 200 years, we\u2019ll have what we had the past 200 years: the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.\u00a0 \u00a0 We just need to remember who we are.\u00a0We are the United States of America.\u00a0The United States of America.\u00a0 \u00a0 And may God protect our nation. And may God protect all those who stand watch over our democracy. God bless you all.\u00a0Democracy. Thank you.\u00a0 ",

        "intro": "President Biden makes an impassioned plea to stand up to the gun lobby after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and 2 teachers were killed. He calls on elected leaders to pass commonsense gun control laws and notes that \"It\u2019s time to turn this pain into action.\"\n",
        "transcript": " Good evening, fellow Americans. I had hoped, when I became President, I would not have to do this again.\u00a0 Another massacre. Uvalde, Texas. An elementary school. Beautiful, innocent second, third, fourth graders. And how many scores of little children who witnessed what happened see their friends die as if they\u2019re on a battlefield, for God\u2019s sake. They\u2019ll live with it the rest of their lives. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know yet, but there\u2019s a lot we do know. There are parents who will never see their child again, never have them jump in bed and cuddle with them. Parents who will never be the same. To lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away. There\u2019s a hollowness in your chest, and you feel like you\u2019re being sucked into it and never going to be able to get out. It\u2019s suffocating. And it\u2019s never quite the same. And it\u2019s a feeling shared by the siblings, and the grandparents, and their family members, and the community that\u2019s left behind. Scripture says\u2014Jill and I have talked about this in different contexts, in other contexts: \u201cThe Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.\u201d So many crushed spirits. So, tonight, I ask the nation to pray for them, to give the parents and siblings the strength in the darkness they feel right now. As a nation, we have to ask: When in God\u2019s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God\u2019s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done? It\u2019s been 340\u20143,448 days\u201410 years since I stood up at a high school in Connecticut\u2014a grade school in Connecticut, where another gunman massacred 26 people, including 20 first graders, at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Since then, there have been over 900 incidents of gunfires reported on school grounds. Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Santa Fe High School in Texas. Oxford High School in Michigan. The list goes on and on. And the list grows when it includes mass shootings at places like movie theaters, houses of worship, and, as we saw just 10 days ago, at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. I am sick and tired of it. We have to act. And don\u2019t tell me we can\u2019t have an impact on this carnage. I spent my career as a senator and as Vice President working to pass commonsense gun laws. We can\u2019t and won\u2019t prevent every tragedy. But we know they work and have a positive impact. When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled. The idea that an 18-year-old kid can walk into a gun store and buy two assault weapons is just wrong. What in God\u2019s name do you need an assault weapon for except to kill someone? Deer aren\u2019t running through the forest with Kevlar vests on, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s just sick. And the gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons which make them the most and largest profit. For God\u2019s sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry. Here\u2019s what else I know: Most Americans support commonsense laws\u2014commonsense gun laws. \u00a0 I just got off my trip from Asia, meeting with Asian leaders, and I learned of this while I was on the aircraft. And what struck me on that 17-hour flight\u2014what struck me was these kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in the world.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0They have mental health problems. They have domestic disputes in other countries. They have people who are lost. But these kinds of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency that they happen in America. Why? Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?\u00a0Where in God\u2019s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with it and stand up to the lobbies?\u00a0\u2028\u2028It\u2019s time to turn this pain into action. For every parent, for every citizen in this country, we have to make it clear to every elected official in this country: It\u2019s time to act. It\u2019s time\u2014for those who obstruct or delay or block the commonsense gun laws, we need to let you know that we will not forget. We can do so much more. We have to do more. Our prayer tonight is for those parents, lying in bed and trying to figure out, \u201cWill I be able to sleep again? What do I say to my other children? What happens tomorrow?\u201d\u2028\u2028 May God bless the loss of innocent life on this sad day. And may the Lord be near the brokenhearted and save those crushed in spirit, because they\u2019re going to need a lot of help and a lot of our prayers. \u2028\u2028God love you. ",

        "date": "March 26, 2022",
        "location": "The White House",
        "intro": "At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland, President Joe Biden talks about Russian aggression and the war in Ukraine. He points to the unity of the democracies in Europe and their resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. He pleads to the Russian people to know that they are not the enemy but the United States and its allies will fight against President Vladimir Putin and his supporters to free Ukraine.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, be seated. (Laughter.) If you don\u2019t, come up on stage. Thank you very much. It\u2019s a great honor to be here. Mr. President, they tell me you\u2019re over there somewhere. There you are. Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 \u201cBe not afraid.\u201d They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II. Words that would change the world. John Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power\u2014the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people.\u00a0 In the face of a cruel and brutal system of government, it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war.\u00a0 When Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979, the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron Curtain. Then a year later, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. And while I know he couldn\u2019t be here tonight, we\u2019re all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa. (Applause.)\u00a0 It reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard: \u201c[F]aith sees best in the dark.\u201d And there were dark moments. Ten years later, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Poland and Central and Eastern Europe would soon be free. Nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy. It was a long, painful slog fought over not days and months, but years and decades. But we emerged anew in the great battle for freedom: a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force. In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, members of the Parliament, distinguished guests, and the people of Poland, and I suspect some people of Ukraine that are here: We\u2019re\u2014(applause)\u2014we are gathered here at the Royal Castle in this city that holds a sacred place in the history of not only of Europe, but humankind\u2019s unending search for freedom. For generations, Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailed. In fact, it was here in Warsaw when a young refugee, who fled her home country from Czechoslovakia was under\u00a0Soviet domination, came back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissidents. Her name was Madeleine Korbel Albright. She became\u2014(applause)\u2014one of the most ardent supporters of democracy in the world. She was a friend with whom I served. America\u2019s first woman Secretary of State. She passed away three days ago. She fought her whole life for essential democratic principles. And now, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nation. And their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for an essential democratic principles that unite all free people: the rule of law; free and fair elections; the freedom to speak, to write, and to assemble; the freedom to worship as one chooses; freedom of the press. These principles are essential in a free society. (Applause.) But they have always\u2014they have always been under siege. They\u2019ve always been embattled. Every generation has had to defeat democracy\u2019s mortal foes. That\u2019s the way of the world\u2014for the world is imperfect, as we know. Where the appetites and ambitions of a few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of many. My message to the people of Ukraine is the message I delivered today to Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, who I believe are here tonight: We stand with you. Period.\u00a0 Today\u2019s fighting in Kyiv and Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battle in a long struggle: Hungary, 1956; Poland, 1956 then again 1981; Czechoslovakia, 1968.\u00a0 Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings, but the resistance continued until finally, in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all of the walls of Soviet domination\u2014they fell. They fell. And the people prevailed.\u00a0 But the battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War. Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones: contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself. Today, Russia has strangled democracy\u2014has sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland. Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, it has\u00a0invalidated\u00a0[invaded] neighboring nations. Putin has the gall to say he\u2019s \u201cde-Nazifying\u201d Ukraine. It\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s just cynical. He knows that. And it\u2019s also obscene. President Zelenskyy was democratically elected. He\u2019s Jewish. His father\u2019s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust. And Putin has the audacity, like all autocrats before him, to believe that might will make right. In my own country, a former president named Abraham Lincoln voiced the opposing spirit to save our Union in the midst of a civil war. He said, \u201cLet us have faith that right makes might.\u201d \u201cRight makes might.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Today, let us now have that faith again. Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the denigns [sic] of our\u2014the designs of autocracy. Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time. The Kremlin wants to portray NATO enlargement as an imperial project aimed at destabilizing Russia. Nothing is further from the truth. NATO is a defensive alliance. It has never sought the demise of Russia. In the lead-up to the current crisis, the United States and NATO worked for months to engage Russia to avert a war. I met with him in person and talked to him many times on the phone.\u00a0 Time and again, we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security, enhance transparency, and build confidence on all sides. But Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation, with lies and ultimatums. Russia was bent on violence from the start. I know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying, \u201cThey are going to cross the border. They are going to attack.\u201d\u00a0 Repeatedly, he asserted, \u201cWe have no interest in war.\u201d Guaranteed he would not move.\u00a0 Repeatedly saying he would not invade Ukraine. Repeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for \u201ctraining\u201d\u2014all 180,000 of them.\u00a0 There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia\u2019s choice of war. It\u2019s an example of one of the oldest of human impulses: using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control. It\u2019s nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War Two. And it threatens to return to decades of war that ravaged Europe before the international rule-based order was put in place. We cannot go back to that. We cannot. \u00a0 The gravity of the threat is why the response of the West has been so swift and so powerful and so unified, unprecedented, and overwhelming. Swift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course.\u00a0 Within days of its invasion, the West had moved jointly with sanctions to damage Russia\u2019s economy. Russia\u2019s Central Bank is now blocked from the global financial systems, denying Kremlin\u2019s access to the war fund it stashed around the globe. We\u2019ve aimed at the heart of Russia\u2019s economy by stopping the imports of Russian energy to the United States. To date, the United States has sanctioned 140 Russian oligarchs and their family members, seizing their ill-begotten gains: their yachts, their luxury apartments, their mansions. We\u2019ve sanctioned more than 400 Russian government officials, including key architects of this war. These officials and oligarchs have reaped enormous benefit from the corruption connected to the Kremlin, and now they have to share in the pain.\u00a0 The private sector is acting as well. Over 400 private multinational companies have pulled out of doing business in Russia\u2014left Russia completely\u2014from oil companies to McDonald\u2019s. As a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the ruble almost is immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy\u2014(applause)\u2014that\u2019s true, by the way. It takes about 200 rubles to equal one dollar.\u00a0 The economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years. It was ranked\u2014Russia\u2019s economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this evasion [sic]\u2014invasion. It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world.\u00a0 Taken together, these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might. These international sanctions are sapping Russian strength, its ability to replenish its military, and its ability\u2014its ability to project power. And it is Putin\u2014it is Vladimir Putin who is to blame, period. \u00a0 At the same time, alongside these economic sanctions, the Western world has come together to provide for the people of Ukraine with incredible levels of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance. In the years before the invasion, we, America, had sent over $650 million, before they crossed the border, in weapons to Ukraine, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment. Since the invasion, America has committed another $1.35 billion in weapons and ammunition. And thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people\u2014(applause)\u2014the equipment we\u2019ve sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our Allies and partners have stepped up as well. But as I\u2019ve made clear: American forces are in Europe\u2014not in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces. American forces are here to defend NATO Allies. Yesterday, I met with the troops that are serving alongside our Polish allies to bolster NATO\u2019s frontline defenses. The reason we wanted to make clear is their movement on Ukraine: Don\u2019t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory. We have a sacred obligation\u2014(applause)\u2014we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power. And earlier today, I visited your National Stadium, where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask: \u201cMy God, what\u2019s going to happen to me? What\u2019s going to happen to my family?\u201d I saw tears in many of the mothers\u2019 eyes as I embraced them; their young children\u2014their young children not sure whether to smile or cry. One little girl said, \u201cMr. President\u201d\u2014she spoke a little English\u2014\u201cis my brother and my daddy\u2014are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?\u201d Without their husbands, their fathers, in many cases, their brothers or sisters who stayed back to fight for their country. I didn\u2019t have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes, the way they gripped my hand, and little kids hung on to my leg, praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary; apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes, almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over again. But I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsaw\u2014for that matter, all the Polish people\u2014for the depths of their compassion, their willingness to reach out\u2014(applause)\u2014opening their hearts. I was saying to the Mayor they\u2019re preparing to open their hearts and their homes simply to help. I also want to thank my friend, the great American chef, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, and his team who helped feeling [sic] those\u2014(applause)\u2014feeding those who are yearning to be free.\u00a0 But helping these refugees is not something Poland or any other nation should carry alone. All the world democracies have a responsibility to help. All of them. And the people of Ukraine can count on the United States to meet its responsibility. I\u2019ve announced, two days ago, we will welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. We already have 8,000 a week coming to the United States of other nat-\u2014nationalities. We\u2019ll provide nearly $300 million of humanitarian assistance, providing tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine, and other basic supplies. In Brussels, I announced the United States is prepared to provide more than $1 billion, in addition, in humanitarian aid. The World Food Programme told us that despite significant obstacles, at least some relief is getting to major cities in Ukraine, but not Metropol [sic]\u2014no, excuse me, Mar-\u2014not Mariupol, because Russian forces are blocking relief supplies. But we\u2019ll not cease our efforts to get humanitarian relief wherever it is needed in Ukraine and for the people who\u2019ve made it out of Ukraine. Notwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin, let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already. Having lost children myself\u2014I know that\u2019s no solace to the people who\u2019ve lost family. But he, Putin, thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance. Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia\u2019s brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve.\u00a0 Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been.\u00a0 Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now\u00a0he has\u00a0[we have] a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO. In fact\u2014(applause)\u2014Russia has managed to cause something I\u2019m sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that we\u2019d once taken years to accomplish. It\u2019s not only Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy\u2019s blessing. It\u2019s our own country\u2014his own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protestors. Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left. There\u2019s a brain drain\u2014leaving Russia. Shutting down independent news. State media is all propaganda, blocking the image of civilian targets, mass graves, starvation tactics of the Russian forces in Ukraine. Is it any wonder, as I said, that 200,000 Russians have all left their country in one month? A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time, which brings me to my message to the Russian people: I\u2019ve worked with Russian leaders for decades. I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the Cold War. I\u2019ve always spoken directly and honestly to you, the Russian people.\u00a0 Let me say this, if you\u2019re able to listen: You, the Russian people, are not our enemy.\u00a0 I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God\u2019s sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs; or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee; supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission.\u00a0 Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine\u2019s children. These are not the actions of a great nation.\u00a0 Of all people, you, the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe, still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the late thirties and forties\u2014the situation of World War Two\u2014still fresh in the minds of many grandparents in the region. What\u2014whatever your generation experienced\u2014whether it experienced the Siege of Leningrad or heard about it from your parents and grandparents\u2014train stations overflowing with terrified families fleeing their homes; nights sheltering in basements and cellars; mornings sitting through the rubble in your homes\u2014these are not memories of the past. Not anymore. Because it\u2019s exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now.\u00a0 March 26, 2022. Just days before\u2014we\u2019re at the twenty-fir-\u2014you were a 21st century nation with hopes and dreams that people all over the world have for themselves and their family.\u00a0 Now, Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it\u2019s taking Russia back to the 19th century. This is not who you are. This is not the future reserve\u2014you deserve for your families and your children. I\u2019m telling you the truth: This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people. Putin can and must end this war. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peace. And my message to the rest of Europe: This new battle for freedom has already made a few things crystal clear.\u00a0 First, Europe must end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. And we, the United States, will help. That\u2019s why just yesterday, in Brussels, I announced a plan with the President of the European Commission to get Europe through the immediate energy crisis. Over the long term, as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet, we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean, renewable energy. And we\u2019ll work together to help get that done so that the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over. They must end. They must end. And second, we have to fight the corruption coming from the Kremlin to give the Russian people a fair chance. And finally, and most urgently, we maintain absolute unity\u2014we must\u2014among the world\u2019s democracies. It\u2019s not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish, of ennobling words of democracy, of freedom, equality, and liberty. All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day. My country as well. That\u2019s why\u2014(applause)\u2014that\u2019s why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO, for the G7, for the European Union, for all freedom-loving nations: We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come.\u00a0 It will not be easy. There will be costs. But it\u2019s a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere. Time and again, history shows that it\u2019s from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows. And history shows this is the task of our time, the task of this generation. Let\u2019s remember: The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall, the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader; it was the people of Europe who, for decades, fought to free themselves. Their sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the Pan-European Picnic. They joined hands for the Baltic Way. They stood for Solidarity here in Poland. And together, it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstand. And we\u2019re seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people, showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator.\u00a0 So, in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today: \u201cNever, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid.\u201d\u00a0 A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people\u2019s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia\u2014for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. We will have a different future\u2014a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.\u00a0 For God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u00a0 God bless you all. And may God defend our freedom. And may God protect our troops. \u00a0Thank you for your patience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ",

Members of Congress and the Cabinet.\u00a0Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.\u00a0\u00a0 Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.\u00a0 Tonight, we meet as Democrats,\u00a0Republicans,\u00a0and Independents.\u00a0But most importantly as Americans.\u00a0 With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.\u00a0 And with an unwavering resolve\u00a0that freedom\u00a0will always triumph over tyranny.\u00a0 Six days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.\u00a0But he badly miscalculated.\u00a0 He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.\u00a0Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.\u00a0 He met the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 From President\u00a0Zelenskyy\u00a0to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their\u00a0determination, inspires the world.\u00a0 Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.\u00a0Everyone from students to retirees, teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\u00a0 In this struggle as President\u00a0Zelenskyy\u00a0said in his speech to the European Parliament \u201cLight will win over darkness.\u201d\u00a0The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States\u00a0is here tonight.\u00a0 Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.\u00a0 Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America\u00a0stand with the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Throughout our history, we\u2019ve learned this lesson\u00a0when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression,\u00a0they cause more chaos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They keep moving.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the costs and the threats\u00a0to America and the world\u00a0keep rising.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s why the NATO Alliance\u00a0was created\u00a0to secure peace\u00a0and stability in Europe\u00a0after World War 2.\u00a0 The United States\u00a0is a member\u00a0along with 29\u00a0other nations.\u00a0 It matters.\u00a0American diplomacy matters.\u00a0American resolve matters.\u00a0 Putin\u2019s latest attack on Ukraine\u00a0was premeditated and unprovoked.\u00a0 He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\u00a0 He thought the West\u00a0and NATO\u00a0wouldn\u2019t respond.\u00a0 And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was\u00a0wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We prepared extensively and carefully.\u00a0 We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa\u00a0to confront Putin.\u00a0 I spent countless hours unifying our European allies.\u00a0We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.\u00a0\u00a0 We countered Russia\u2019s lies with truth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And now that he has acted, the free world is\u00a0holding him\u00a0accountable.\u00a0 Along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.\u00a0 We are inflicting pain on Russia\u00a0and supporting the people of Ukraine.\u00a0Putin is now isolated from the world\u00a0more than ever.\u00a0 Together with our allies, we are right now\u00a0enforcing powerful economic sanctions.\u00a0 We are cutting off Russia\u2019s largest banks from the international financial system.\u00a0\u00a0 Preventing Russia\u2019s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble, making Putin\u2019s $630 Billion \u201cwar fund\u201d worthless.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are choking off Russia\u2019s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\u00a0\u00a0 Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, no more.\u00a0 The US Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.\u00a0\u00a0 We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\u00a0 And tonight, I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights\u2014further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.\u00a0 The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value\u00a0and trading remains suspended. Russia\u2019s economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.\u00a0 Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance.\u00a0Humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.\u00a0 And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.\u00a0\u00a0 Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces\u00a0in Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0 Our forces are\u00a0not\u00a0going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies\u2014in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\u00a0\u00a0 For that purpose, we\u2019ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\u00a0 As I have made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.\u00a0\u00a0 And we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage.\u00a0But the next few days weeks,\u00a0months, will be hard on them.\u00a0\u00a0 Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\u00a0 And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years\u00a0of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take\u00a0their country backwards.\u00a0\u00a0 To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised.\u00a0A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\u00a0 And I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\u00a0 Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release\u00a060 million\u00a0barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\u00a0\u00a0 America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\u00a0\u00a0And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.\u00a0\u00a0 These steps will help blunt gas prices\u00a0here at home.\u00a0And I know the news about what\u2019s happening\u00a0can seem alarming.\u00a0 But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\u00a0 When the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\u00a0 While it shouldn\u2019t have taken something\u00a0so terrible for people around\u00a0the world to see what\u2019s at stake,\u00a0now everyone sees it clearly.\u00a0 We see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe, a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0 In the battle between democracy and\u00a0autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\u00a0 This is a real test. It\u2019s going to take time.\u00a0So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations, we stand with you.\u00a0 Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls\u00a0of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 He will never extinguish their love of\u00a0freedom.\u00a0He\u00a0will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\u00a0 We meet tonight in an America that has lived through\u00a0two of the hardest years this nation\u00a0has ever faced.\u00a0 The pandemic has been punishing.\u00a0 And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.\u00a0 I understand.\u00a0 I remember when my dad had to leave our home\u00a0in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work.\u00a0 I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up,\u00a0you felt it.\u00a0 That\u2019s why\u00a0one of the first things I did\u00a0as President was fight to pass\u00a0the American Rescue Plan.\u00a0\u00a0 Because people were hurting. We needed to act,\u00a0and we did.\u00a0 Few pieces of legislation\u00a0have done more\u00a0in a critical moment in our history\u00a0to lift us out of crisis.\u00a0 It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19.\u00a0It delivered immediate economic relief\u00a0for tens of millions of Americans.\u00a0\u00a0 Helped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads,\u00a0and cut the cost of health insurance.\u00a0 And as my dad used to say,\u00a0it gave people a little breathing room.\u00a0 And unlike the $2-trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1 percent of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people\u2014and left no one behind.\u00a0 And it\u00a0worked.\u00a0It\u00a0created jobs.\u00a0Lots of jobs.\u00a0 In fact\u2014our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year,\u00a0more jobs created in one year\u00a0than ever before\u00a0in the history of America.\u00a0 Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7 percent last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn\u2019t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.\u00a0\u00a0 For the past 40 years, we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.\u00a0 But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\u00a0 Vice President Harris and I ran for office\u00a0with a new economic\u00a0vision for America.\u00a0 Invest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up\u00a0and the middle out,\u00a0not from the top down.\u00a0\u00a0 Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up\u00a0and the wealthy do very well.\u00a0 America used to have the best\u00a0roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.\u00a0 Now our infrastructure\u00a0is ranked 13th\u00a0in the world.\u00a0 We won\u2019t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st\u00a0Century\u00a0if we don\u2019t fix that.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2014the most sweeping investment to\u00a0rebuild America in history.\u00a0 This was a bipartisan effort,\u00a0and I want to thank\u00a0the members of both\u00a0parties\u00a0who\u00a0worked\u00a0to make it happen.\u00a0 We\u2019re done talking about\u00a0infrastructure weeks.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have an infrastructure decade.\u00a0 It is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century\u00a0that we face with the rest of the world\u2014particularly with China.\u00a0\u00a0 As I\u2019ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people.\u00a0 We\u2019ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways\u00a0all across America.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\u00a0 We\u2019ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes\u2014so every child\u2014and every American\u2014has\u00a0clean water to drink at home and\u00a0at\u00a0school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American\u2014urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities.\u00a0 4,000 projects\u00a0have already been announced.\u00a0 And tonight, I\u2019m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\u00a0 When we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America\u2014we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs.\u00a0 The federal government spends about $600 Billion a year\u00a0to keep the country safe and secure.\u00a0 There\u2019s been a law on the books\u00a0for almost a century\u00a0to make sure taxpayers\u2019 dollars\u00a0support American jobs and businesses.\u00a0 Every Administration says they\u2019ll do it,\u00a0but we are actually doing it.\u00a0 We will buy American to make sure everything from\u00a0the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails\u00a0are made in America.\u00a0 But to compete\u00a0for the best jobs of the future,\u00a0we also need to level the playing field\u00a0with China and other competitors.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies\u00a0and American manufacturing.\u00a0 Let me give you one example of why\u00a0it\u2019s so important to pass it.\u00a0 If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0you\u2019ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\u00a0 It won\u2019t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you\u2019ll see a \u201cField of dreams,\u201d\u00a0the ground on which America\u2019s future will be built.\u00a0 This is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20\u00a0billion semiconductor \u201cmega site.\u201d\u00a0 Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place, 10,000 new good-paying jobs.\u00a0 Some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world\u00a0to make computer chips the size of a fingertip\u00a0that power the world and our everyday lives.\u00a0 Smartphones. The Internet.\u00a0Technology we have yet to invent.\u00a0 But that\u2019s just the beginning.\u00a0 Intel\u2019s CEO, Pat\u00a0Gelsinger,\u00a0who is here tonight,\u00a0told me they are ready\u00a0to increase their investment from\u00a0$20 billion to $100\u00a0billion.\u00a0 That would be one of the biggest investments\u00a0in manufacturing in American history.\u00a0 And all they\u2019re waiting for\u00a0is for you to pass this bill.\u00a0 So let\u2019s not wait any longer.\u00a0Send it to my desk.\u00a0I\u2019ll sign it.\u00a0\u00a0 And we will really take off.\u00a0 And Intel is not alone.\u00a0 There\u2019s something happening in America.\u00a0 Just look around\u00a0and you\u2019ll see an amazing story.\u00a0 The rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products \u201cMade in America.\u201d\u00a0The revitalization of American manufacturing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago,\u00a0they would have built them overseas.\u00a0 That\u2019s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles,\u00a0creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\u00a0 GM is making the largest investment in its history\u2014$7\u00a0billion to build electric vehicles,\u00a0creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\u00a0 All told,\u00a0we created 369,000\u00a0new manufacturing jobs in America\u00a0just last year.\u00a0 Powered by people I\u2019ve met like\u00a0JoJo\u00a0Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers\u00a0from\u00a0Pittsburgh, who\u2019s here with us tonight.\u00a0 As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time to bury the label \u201cRust Belt.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\u00a0 But with all the bright spots in our economy,\u00a0record job growth and higher wages,\u00a0too many families are struggling\u00a0to keep up with the bills.\u00a0\u00a0 Inflation is robbing them\u00a0of the gains they might otherwise feel.\u00a0 I get it.\u00a0That\u2019s why my top priority\u00a0is getting prices under control.\u00a0 Look, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that\u00a0businesses had a hard time\u00a0hiring enough workers\u00a0to keep up production in their factories.\u00a0 The pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.\u00a0 When factories close,\u00a0it takes longer to make goods\u00a0and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.\u00a0 Look at cars.\u00a0 Last year,\u00a0there weren\u2019t enough\u00a0semiconductors to make all the cars\u00a0that people wanted to buy.\u00a0 And guess what,\u00a0prices of automobiles went up.\u00a0 So\u2014we have a choice.\u00a0 One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages\u00a0and make Americans poorer.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a better plan to fight inflation.\u00a0 Lower your\u00a0costs,\u00a0not your wages.\u00a0 Make more cars and semiconductors\u00a0in America.\u00a0 More infrastructure and innovation\u00a0in America.\u00a0 More goods moving faster and cheaper in America.\u00a0 More jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\u00a0 And instead of relying on foreign supply chains,\u00a0let\u2019s make it in America.\u00a0 Economists call it \u201cincreasing the productive capacity of our economy.\u201d\u00a0 I call it building a better America.\u00a0 My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\u00a0 Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here\u2019s the plan:\u00a0 First\u2014cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.\u00a0\u00a0 He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.\u00a0\u00a0 But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua\u2019s mom.\u00a0 Imagine what it\u2019s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you\u2019re going to pay for it.\u00a0\u00a0 What it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye,\u00a0to be the parent you expect to be.\u00a0 Joshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.\u00a0\u00a0 For Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let\u2019s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\u00a0\u00a0 Drug companies will still do very well. And while we\u2019re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.\u00a0 Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let\u2019s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\u00a0 Second\u2014cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit;\u00a0\u00a0 Double America\u2019s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;\u00a0\u00a0 Lower the price of electric vehicles,\u00a0saving you another $80 a month because\u00a0you\u2019ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.\u00a0 Third\u2014cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.\u00a0\u00a0 Middle-class and working families shouldn\u2019t have to pay more than 7 percent of their income for care of young children.\u00a0\u00a0 My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn\u2019t afford child care,\u00a0to be able to get back to work.\u00a0 My plan doesn\u2019t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing.\u00a0And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.\u00a0\u00a0 All of these will lower costs.\u00a0 And under my plan,\u00a0nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.\u00a0\u00a0 The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m not looking to punish anyone. But let\u2019s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share.\u00a0 Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s simply not fair. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a 15-percent minimum tax rate for corporations.\u00a0 We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate\u00a0so companies can\u2019t get out of paying their taxes\u00a0at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don\u2019t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.\u00a0\u00a0 So that\u2019s my plan.\u00a0It will grow the economy and lower costs for families.\u00a0 So what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s get this done.\u00a0And while you\u2019re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\u00a0\u00a0 My plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\u00a0 The previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.\u00a0 But in my administration,\u00a0the watchdogs have been\u00a0welcomed back.\u00a0 We\u2019re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.\u00a0\u00a0 And tonight,\u00a0I\u2019m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\u00a0 By the end of this year,\u00a0the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\u00a0\u00a0 The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.\u00a0 Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition.\u00a0 I\u2019m a capitalist,\u00a0but capitalism without competition\u00a0isn\u2019t capitalism.\u00a0 It\u2019s exploitation\u2014and it drives up prices.\u00a0 When corporations don\u2019t have to compete, their\u00a0profits go up, your\u00a0prices go up,\u00a0and small businesses\u00a0and family farmers and ranchers\u00a0go under.\u00a0 We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America.\u00a0 During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000 percent and made record profits.\u00a0 Tonight,\u00a0I\u2019m announcing a crackdown\u00a0on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\u00a0 And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes,\u00a0quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.\u00a0\u00a0 That ends on my watch.\u00a0 Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships,\u00a0hire them based on their skills not degrees.\u00a0 Let\u2019s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.\u00a0\u00a0 Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit,\u00a0so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\u00a0 Let\u2019s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill\u2014our First Lady who teaches full-time\u2014calls America\u2019s best-kept secret:\u00a0community colleges.\u00a0 And let\u2019s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union\u2014they shouldn\u2019t be stopped.\u00a0\u00a0 When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven\u2019t done in a long time: build a better America.\u00a0 For more than two years,\u00a0COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\u00a0 And I know you\u2019re tired,\u00a0frustrated,\u00a0and exhausted.\u00a0 But I also know this.\u00a0 Because of the progress we\u2019ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say\u00a0we are moving forward safely,\u00a0back to more normal routines.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve reached a new moment\u00a0in the fight against COVID-19,\u00a0with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.\u00a0\u00a0 Just a few days ago,\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014the CDC\u2014issued new mask guidelines.\u00a0 Under these new guidelines,\u00a0most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\u00a0 Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.\u00a0\u00a0 I know some are talking about \u201cliving with COVID-19.\u201d Tonight I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19.\u00a0 We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases.\u00a0And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads,\u00a0we will stay on guard.\u00a0 Here are four common sense steps\u00a0as we move forward safely.\u00a0\u00a0 First,\u00a0stay protected with vaccines and treatments.\u00a0We know how incredibly effective vaccines are.\u00a0If you\u2019re vaccinated and boosted, you have the highest degree of protection.\u00a0 We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now,\u00a0I know parents with kids under 5\u00a0are eager to see a vaccine authorized\u00a0for their children.\u00a0 The scientists are working hard to get that done and we\u2019ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do.\u00a0 We\u2019re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19,\u00a0the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month\u00a0and more than double that next month.\u00a0\u00a0 And we\u2019re launching the \u201cTest to Treat\u201d initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they\u2019re positive,\u00a0receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\u00a0\u00a0 If you\u2019re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability,\u00a0we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\u00a0 We\u2019re leaving no one behind\u00a0or ignoring anyone\u2019s needs as we move forward.\u00a0 And on testing,\u00a0we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov\u00a0starting next week.\u00a0 Second\u2014we must prepare for new variants.\u00a0Over the past year, we\u2019ve gotten much better at detecting new variants.\u00a0 If necessary, we\u2019ll be able to deploy new\u00a0vaccines within 100\u00a0days instead of many\u00a0more months or years.\u00a0\u00a0 And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we\u2019ll have new stockpiles of\u00a0tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.\u00a0 I cannot promise a new variant won\u2019t come.\u00a0But I can promise you we\u2019ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\u00a0\u00a0 Third\u2014we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses.\u00a0We have the tools we need.\u00a0 It\u2019s time for Americans to get back to work\u00a0and fill our great downtowns again.\u00a0People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\u00a0 Our schools are open. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\u00a0Our kids need to be in school.\u00a0 And with 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom,\u00a0and move forward safely.\u00a0 We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests,\u00a0and masks.\u00a0 Of course,\u00a0continuing this costs money.\u00a0 I will soon send Congress a request.\u00a0 The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again,\u00a0so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fourth,\u00a0we will continue vaccinating the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries,\u00a0more than any other nation.\u00a0 And we won\u2019t stop.\u00a0 We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all,\u00a0so much loss of life.\u00a0 Let\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is:\u00a0A\u00a0God-awful disease.\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies,\u00a0and start seeing each other for who we really are:\u00a0Fellow Americans.\u00a0\u00a0 We can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.\u00a0 I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner,\u00a0Officer Jason Rivera.\u00a0 They were responding to a 9-1-1 call\u00a0when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\u00a0 Officer Mora was 27 years old.\u00a0 Officer Rivera was 22.\u00a0 Both Dominican Americans\u00a0who\u2019d grown up on the same streets\u00a0they later chose to patrol as police officers.\u00a0 I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice,\u00a0and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\u00a0 I\u2019ve worked on these issues a long time.\u00a0 I know what works:\u00a0Investing in crime prevention\u00a0and community police officers who\u2019ll walk the beat, who\u2019ll know the neighborhood,\u00a0and who can restore trust and safety.\u00a0 So let\u2019s not abandon our streets.\u00a0Or choose between safety and equal justice.\u00a0 Let\u2019s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the Justice Department required body\u00a0cameras,\u00a0banned\u00a0chokeholds,\u00a0and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption\u2014trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.\u00a0\u00a0 We should all agree:\u00a0The answer is not to Defund the police.\u00a0The answer is to FUND the police\u00a0with the resources and training\u00a0they need to protect our communities.\u00a0 I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\u00a0\u00a0 And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home\u2014they have no serial numbers and can\u2019t be traced.\u00a0 And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?\u00a0 Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\u00a0 Repeal the liability shield\u00a0that makes gun manufacturers\u00a0the only industry in America\u00a0that can\u2019t be sued.\u00a0 These laws don\u2019t infringe\u00a0on the Second Amendment.\u00a0They save lives.\u00a0 The most fundamental right in America is the\u00a0right to vote\u2014and\u00a0to have\u00a0it counted. And it\u2019s under assault.\u00a0 In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote,\u00a0but to subvert entire elections.\u00a0 We cannot let this happen.\u00a0 Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it,\u00a0pass the Disclose Act\u00a0so Americans can know\u00a0who is funding our elections.\u00a0 Tonight, I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer,\u00a0thank you for your service.\u00a0 One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has\u00a0is nominating someone to serve\u00a0on the United States Supreme Court.\u00a0 And I did that 4 days ago,\u00a0when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge\u00a0Ketanji\u00a0Brown Jackson.\u00a0One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds,\u00a0who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy\u00a0of excellence.\u00a0 A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public-school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support\u2014from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0 And if we are to advance liberty and justice,\u00a0we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.\u00a0 We can do both. At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\u00a0 We\u2019re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\u00a0 We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land\u2014my\u00a0forefathers and so many of yours.\u00a0 Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers,\u00a0and essential workers.\u00a0 Revise our laws\u00a0so businesses have the workers they need\u00a0and families don\u2019t wait decades to reunite.\u00a0 It\u2019s not only the right thing to do\u2014it\u2019s the economically smart thing to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s why immigration reform is supported by\u00a0everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the US Chamber of Commerce.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get it done once and for all.\u00a0 Advancing liberty and justice\u00a0also requires protecting the rights of women.\u00a0 The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade\u2014standing precedent for half a century\u2014is under attack\u00a0as never before.\u00a0 If we want to go forward\u2014not backward\u2014we must protect access to health care.\u00a0Preserve a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u00a0And let\u2019s continue to advance\u00a0maternal health care in America.\u00a0 And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let\u2019s finally get the bipartisan Equality\u00a0Act\u00a0to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\u00a0 As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\u00a0 While it often appears that we never agree, that isn\u2019t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\u00a0 And soon, we\u2019ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\u00a0 So\u00a0tonight I\u2019m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation.\u00a0Four big things we can do together.\u00a0\u00a0 First, beat the opioid epidemic.\u00a0 There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\u00a0\u00a0 Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\u00a0 If you\u2019re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery,\u00a0and I celebrate the 23 million Americans\u00a0in recovery.\u00a0 Second, let\u2019s take on mental health. Especially among our children,\u00a0whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\u00a0\u00a0 The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\u00a0\u00a0 I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that.\u00a0And we can all play a part\u2014sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\u00a0 Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence,\u00a0trauma,\u00a0and the harms of social media.\u00a0 As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they\u2019re conducting on our children for profit.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to strengthen privacy protections,\u00a0ban targeted advertising to children,\u00a0demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our\u00a0children.\u00a0 And let\u2019s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to\u00a0for help,\u00a0and full parity between\u00a0physical and mental health care.\u00a0 Third,\u00a0support our veterans.\u00a0 Veterans are the best of us.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\u00a0 My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing,\u00a0and now helping lower-income veterans\u00a0get VA care debt-free.\u00a0\u00a0 Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan\u00a0faced many dangers.\u00a0 One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from \u201cburn pits\u201d that incinerated wastes of war\u2014medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\u00a0 When they came home,\u00a0many of the world\u2019s fittest\u00a0and best trained warriors\u00a0were never the same.\u00a0 Headaches.\u00a0Numbness.\u00a0Dizziness.\u00a0 A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\u00a0 I know.\u00a0 One of those soldiers\u00a0was my son Major Beau Biden.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain\u00a0cancer,\u00a0or\u00a0the diseases of so many of our troops.\u00a0 But I\u2019m committed to finding out everything we can.\u00a0 Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\u00a0 The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\u00a0\u00a0 He was born a soldier.\u00a0Army National Guard.\u00a0Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\u00a0 Stationed near Baghdad,\u00a0just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\u00a0 Heath\u2019s widow Danielle is here with us tonight.\u00a0They loved going to Ohio State football games.\u00a0He loved building Legos with their daughter.\u00a0 But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath\u2019s lungs and body.\u00a0 Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know how to stop fighting,\u00a0and neither did she.\u00a0 Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\u00a0 Tonight,\u00a0Danielle\u2014we are.\u00a0 The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases,\u00a0already helping more veterans get benefits.\u00a0 And tonight,\u00a0I\u2019m announcing we\u2019re expanding eligibility\u00a0to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\u00a0 I\u2019m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.\u00a0 And fourth,\u00a0let\u2019s end cancer as we know it.\u00a0 This is personal to me and Jill,\u00a0to Kamala,\u00a0and to so many of you.\u00a0 Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America\u2014second only to heart disease.\u00a0 Last month,\u00a0I announced our plan to supercharge\u00a0the Cancer Moonshot\u00a0that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\u00a0 Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into\u00a0treatable diseases.\u00a0\u00a0 More support for patients and families.\u00a0 To get there,\u00a0I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H,\u00a0the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.\u00a0 It\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.\u00a0\u00a0 ARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer,\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0and more.\u00a0 A unity agenda for the nation.\u00a0 We can do this.\u00a0 My fellow Americans\u2014tonight, we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy.\u00a0 In this Capitol, generation after generation,\u00a0Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.\u00a0 We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty,\u00a0defeated totalitarianism and terror.\u00a0 And built the strongest,\u00a0freest,\u00a0and\u00a0most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\u00a0 Now is the hour.\u00a0Our moment of responsibility.\u00a0Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\u00a0 It is in this moment that our character is formed.\u00a0Our purpose is found.\u00a0Our future is forged.\u00a0 Well, I know this nation.\u00a0We will meet the test.\u00a0To protect freedom and liberty,\u00a0to expand fairness and opportunity.\u00a0 We will save democracy.\u00a0 As hard as these times have been,\u00a0I am more optimistic about America today\u00a0than I have been my whole life.\u00a0 Because I see the future that is within our grasp.\u00a0 Because I know there is simply\u00a0nothing beyond our capacity.\u00a0 We are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity.\u00a0 The only nation that can be defined by a single word:\u00a0possibilities.\u00a0 So on this night,\u00a0in our 245th\u00a0year as a nation,\u00a0I have come to report on the State of the Union.\u00a0 And my report is this:\u00a0the State of the Union is strong\u2014because you, the American people,\u00a0are strong.\u00a0 We are stronger today than we were a year ago.\u00a0 And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.\u00a0 Now is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.\u00a0 And we will, as\u00a0one\u00a0people.\u00a0 One America.\u00a0 The United States of America.\u00a0 May God bless you all.\u00a0May God protect our troops.\u00a0 ",

        "date": "February 24, 2022",
        "location": "The White House",
        "intro": "President Biden gives a statement after President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered the invasion of the country of Ukraine. As Russian troops moved into Ukraine, the United States and its European and NATO allies responded with economic sanctions against Russia. Biden stresses the unity among NATO countries and the fight against oppression and invasion, standing up for freedom and democracy.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity. This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I\u2019ve been\u2014as we\u2019ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border. He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along. He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering. For weeks\u2014for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it\u2019s unfolding largely as we predicted. In the past week, we\u2019ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists. Rus-\u2014the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine. We saw a staged political theater in Moscow\u2014outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was\u2014Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide\u2014without any evidence. We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory. And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war. Within moments\u2014moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine. Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in. We\u2019ve been transparent with the world. We\u2019ve shared declassified evidence about Russia\u2019s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing. Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences. Today, I\u2019m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia. This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time. We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.\u00a0 And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we\u2019ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy. Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy\u2014as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others\u2014to amplify the joint impact of our response. I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia\u2019s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus-\u2014the Russian military. We\u2019re going to impose major\u2014and we\u2019re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy. We\u2019ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia\u2019s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever\u2014ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government\u2019s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent. In today\u2019s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets. We\u2019ve cut off Russia\u2019s largest bank\u2014a bank that holds more than one third of Russia\u2019s banking assets by itself\u2014cut it off from the US financial system.\u00a0 And today, we\u2019re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets. As promised, we\u2019re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning\u2014that we\u2019re sanctioning as well. As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin\u2019s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead. On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from US or European investors. Now, we\u2019re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises\u2014companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion. Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia\u2019s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come. Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we\u2019ll cut off more than half of Russia\u2019s high-tech imports. It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It\u2019ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin\u2019s long-term strategic ambitions.\u00a0 And we\u2019re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we\u2019re imposing, we\u2019re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east. Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit\u2014we\u2019ll be there\u2014to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance. Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year\u2014this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east. As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever. There is no doubt\u2014no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all. Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO. On Tuesday, in response to Russia\u2019s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I\u2019ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO\u2019s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding\u2014the other Allies, the rest of NATO\u2014adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense. And today, within hours of Russia\u2019s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated\u2014an activation of response plans. This will enable NATO\u2019s high-readiness forces to deploy and\u2014when and where they\u2019re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe. And now I\u2019m authorizing additional US forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO\u2019s response, including some of US-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago. I\u2019ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world\u2014NATO. As we respond, my administration is using the tools\u2014every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump. You know, we\u2019re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not\u2014should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits. You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue. We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies. We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant. I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me. But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are. Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond. For months, we have been working closely with our private\u2014with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well. I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We\u2019ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering. And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat. But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil\u2014mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends. The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards. This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a\u2014has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace. But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin\u2014and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin\u2019s desire for empire by any means necessary\u2014by bullying Russia\u2019s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause. Putin\u2019s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world\u2014one where nations take what they want by force. But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power. The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful. And Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly\u2014economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia\u2019s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association. When the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. Liberty, democracy, human dignity\u2014these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people\u2014from people\u2019s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.\u00a0 And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail. God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops. Q: President Biden \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke. Q: Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government? THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what? Q: What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict? THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s a large conflict already. The way we\u2019re going to assure it\u2019s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 And I have no plans to talk with Putin.\u00a0 Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini]. Q: Mr. President, you didn\u2019t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the US isn\u2019t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it? THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence\u2014maybe more consequence than SWIFT\u2014number one.\u00a0 Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that\u2019s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.\u00a0 Cecilia Ve-\u2014Vega, ABC.\u00a0 Q: Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine? And a second question I\u2019ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will\u2014that the We-\u2014the threat that he gave\u2014the West \u201cwill face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.\u201d Is he threatening a nuclear strike? THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he\u2019s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.\u00a0 And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh-\u2014this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what\u2019s coming and so the people of Russia know what he\u2019s brought on them. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u00a0 This is going to take time. It\u2019s not going to occur\u2014he\u2019s going to say, \u201cOh my God, these sanctions are coming. I\u2019m going to stand down.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.\u00a0 Q: Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine? Q: Mr. President\u2014Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes. Q: Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country? And I do have one more question.\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there\u2019s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there\u2019s no doubt about that, number one. Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we\u2019re going to impose on Russia, period.\u00a0 What\u2019s your next question? I\u2019m sorry. Q: The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a \u201cworthy adversary\u201d? THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was\u2014I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was \u201cworthy.\u201d I didn\u2019t underestimate him.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve read most of everything he\u2019s written. Did you read the\u2014I shouldn\u2019t sa-\u2014I\u2019m not being a wise guy. The\u2014you heard the speech he made\u2014almost an hour\u2019s worth of speeches\u2014why he was going into Ukraine.\u00a0 He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0 And I think that his\u2014his ambitions are\u2014are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived. Q: President Biden\u2014President Biden \u2014 Q: And\u2014and with that\u2014with his ambitions, you\u2019re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am. Q: Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can? THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say sanctions couldn\u2019t stop him. Q: But you\u2019ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things. Q: Okay, but \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re two different things. And we\u2019re now going to\u2014he\u2019s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions. Q: And what will that do\u2014how will that change his mindset here, given he\u2019s attacking Ukraine as we speak? THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he\u2019ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond. Q: You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you\u2019re prepared to take? And if not \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not a bluff; it\u2019s on the table. Q: Sanctioning President Putin? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q: Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir? Q: Mr. President \u2014 Q: Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you\u2019re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what\u2019s called \u201cSWIFT\u201d\u2014the international banking system\u2014or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for? THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we\u2019ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that\u2019s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let\u2019s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they\u2019re working. Yes. Q: Let me ask you about\u2014can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up \u2014 Q: What\u2019s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in US and Russian relations? THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in US-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they\u2019re on. And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he\u2019s doing\u2014from Asia to South America to Europe to acr-\u2014around the world.\u00a0 And so, it\u2019s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea\u2014you don\u2019t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense. Q: And are you\u2014are you\u2014if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not prepared to comment on that at the moment. Q: Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah. No, no, no. He\u2019s had his hand up a long time. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the US will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries? THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved\u2014we will be involved. The only thing that I\u2019m convinced of is: If we don\u2019t stop now, he\u2019ll be emboldened. If we don\u2019t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened. Look, you know, every\u2014well, anyway. Q: And can you talk anything more about your conversation \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you. Q: Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States\u2014is India with\u2014fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia? THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States \u2014 Q: Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to be\u2014we\u2019re in consultation with\u2014with India today. We haven\u2019t resolved that completely. Q: One more question \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you. \u00a0 \u00a0 ",

        "location": "The White House",
        "intro": "Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden make remarks on the first anniversary of the violent assault on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Both remember the violence that took place that day in the halls of the US Capitol as senators, representatives, and staff hid from those intent on harm while the Capitol Police and the DC Metropolitan Police Department tried to protect them. They also challenge Americans to protect our Constitution and our Democracy by rejecting lies and relying on the truth. President Biden remarks, \"it\u2019s up to all of us\u2014to 'We the People'\u2014to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.\"\n",
        "transcript": " VICE PRESIDENT: Fellow Americans, good morning. Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them\u2014where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault. Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory. December 7th, 1941. September 11th, 2001. And January 6th, 2021. On that day, I was not only Vice President-elect, I was also a United States senator. And I was here at the Capitol that morning, at a classified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Hours later, the gates of the Capitol were breached. I had left. But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues, but to my staff, who had been forced to seek refuge in our office, converting filing cabinets into barricades. What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders. What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building, hallowed as it is. What they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend. On January 6th, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful. The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos. What was at stake then, and now, is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it: by we, the people\u2014all the people. We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation; by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose roots run old and deep. When I meet with young people, they often ask about the state of our democracy, about January 6th. And what I tell them is: January 6th reflects the dual nature of democracy\u2014its fragility and its strength. You see, the strength of democracy is the rule of law. The strength of democracy is the principle that everyone should be treated equally, that elections should be free and fair, that corruption should be given no quarter. The strength of democracy is that it empowers the people. And the fragility of democracy is this: that if we are not vigilant, if we do not defend it, democracy simply will not stand; it will falter and fail. The violent assault that took place here, the very fact of how close we came to an election overturned\u2014that reflects the fragility of democracy. Yet, the resolve I saw in our elected leaders when I returned to the Senate chamber that night\u2014their resolve not to yield but to certify the election; their loyalty not to party or person but to the Constitution of the United States\u2014that reflects its strength. And so, of course, does the heroism of the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other law enforcement officers who answered the call that day, including those who later succumbed to wounds, both visible and invisible. Our thoughts are with all of the families who have lost a loved one. You know, I wonder, how will January 6th come to be remembered in the years ahead? Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest, greatest democracy in the world or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come? The American spirit is being tested. The answer to whether we will meet that test resides where it always has resided in our country\u2014with you, the people. And the work ahead will not be easy. Here, in this very building, a decision will be made about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair election. Let's be clear: We must pass the voting rights bills that are now before the Senate, and the American people must also do something more. We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defense of our democracy in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity and posterity. That is the preamble of the Constitution that President Biden and I swore an oath to uphold and defend. And that is the enduring promise of the United States of America. My fellow Americans, it is my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment, a leader whose life's work has been moving our nation toward that more perfect union: President Joe Biden. THE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked\u2014simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution\u2014our Constitution\u2014faced the gravest of threats. Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law. Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed. For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol. But they failed. They failed. And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again. I\u2019m speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is\u2014on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.\u00a0 Above him\u2014above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda\u2014is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below. Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The facts and the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes. The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth. Well, here is the God\u2019s truth about January 6th, 2021: Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart. Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021. What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.\u00a0 A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them. Over 140 police officers were injured. We\u2019ve all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med-\u2014\u201cmedieval\u201d battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq. They\u2019ve repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone\u2014anyone\u2014diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through? We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America. But what did we not see? We didn\u2019t see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack\u2014sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation\u2019s capital under siege. This wasn\u2019t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection. They weren\u2019t looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people. They were looking to uphold\u2014they weren\u2019t looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one. They weren\u2019t looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution. This isn\u2019t about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn\u2019t buried. That\u2019s the only way forward. That\u2019s what great nations do. They don\u2019t bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that\u2019s the truth: They face up to it. We are a great nation. My fellow Americans, in life, there\u2019s truth and, tragically, there are lies\u2014lies conceived and spread for profit and power. We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie. And here is the truth: The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He\u2019s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country\u2019s interests and America\u2019s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution. He can\u2019t accept he lost, even though that\u2019s what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost. That\u2019s what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward. He has done what no president in American history\u2014the history of this country\u2014has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people. While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party\u2014the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes. But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible\u2014anything. And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be? Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies? We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it. The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day\u2014November 3rd, 2020. Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting? The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people. Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country\u2014to look at America? I cannot. Here\u2019s the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country. More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic\u2014some at grea-\u2014great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked. Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written\u2014not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost. Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.\u00a0 It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s undemocratic. And frankly, it\u2019s un-American. The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can\u2019t be trusted. The truth is that no election\u2014no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted. Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected\u2014often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court. Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia\u2014Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand. Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly. So, let\u2019s speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn\u2019t based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse\u2014a pretext\u2014to cover for the truth. He\u2019s not just a former president. He\u2019s a defeated former president\u2014defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election. There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case. Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd\u2014the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives\u2014elections in which they closed the gap in the House. They challenge none of that. The President\u2019s name was first, then we went down the line\u2014governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed? And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters. The only difference: The former President didn\u2019t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own. Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation\u2019s true patriots. Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view. To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol. You can\u2019t love your country only when you win. You can\u2019t obey the law only when it\u2019s convenient. You can\u2019t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies. Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America\u2014at American democracy. They didn\u2019t come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage\u2014not in service of America, but rather in service of one man. Those who incited the mob\u2014the real plotters\u2014who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters. But their plot was foiled. Congressmen\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014stayed. Senators, representatives, staff\u2014they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Look, folks, now it\u2019s up to all of us\u2014to \u201cWe the People\u201d\u2014to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive. That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good. Make no mistake about it: We\u2019re living at an inflection point in history. Both at home and abroad, we\u2019re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people\u2019s right of self-determination and self-\u2014the self-seeking autocrat.\u00a0 From China to Russia and beyond, they\u2019re betting that democracy\u2019s days are numbered. They\u2019ve actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today\u2019s rapidly changing, complicated world. And they\u2019re betting\u2014they\u2019re betting America will become more like them and less like us. They\u2019re betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman. I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be. Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world\u2014literally changed the world. Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully\u2014never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun. And they committed to paper an idea that couldn\u2019t live up to\u2014they couldn\u2019t live up to but an idea that couldn\u2019t be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal. We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up. The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values. They want to rule or they will ruin\u2014ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What\u2014and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny. And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors\u2014maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they\u2019re not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea\u2014an idea that requires vigilant stewardship. As we stand here today\u2014one year since January 6th, 2021\u2014the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated. So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted. Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort. Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well. We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day\u2014from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families. Don\u2019t kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep. I said it many times and it\u2019s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious\u2014and greatness of this nation, we will win. Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I\u2019m crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope. From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism. From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation. So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play. I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either. I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.\u00a0 We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred. I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us\u2014about us, not about \u201cme.\u201d Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago\u2014of liberty, freedom, and equality. This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We\u2019re a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence. Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails. So, let us remember: Together, we\u2019re one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy. ",

        "intro": "At the White House, President Joe Biden makes a few remarks before he signs the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The legislation, a $1.2-trillion package, focuses on improving various types of infrastructure, including bridges, roads, public transit, and broadband for internet. The president begins by thanking numerous people who supported the bill. He also details the compromise that was necessary to get the bill passed and the jobs that will be created by it.

        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. \u00a0 AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! \u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Heather. Thank you, thank you, thank you. \u00a0 AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! \u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Well, thank you. Heather, you thought \u2014 you\u2019re surprised you\u2019re standing here. (Laughter.) Jill was very surprised I\u2019m standing here. (Laughter.) \u00a0 Well, Heather, thank you for the introduction. And I can\u2019t look over here because the sun is shining in my eyes, but all this other crowd over here \u2014 and thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you\u2019ve done. (Applause.) \u00a0 Look, thanks for sharing this day with us \u2014 why this day matters to you and our fellow \u2014 your fellow Iron Workers and your families. And you explained it well. \u00a0 And for all the folks at home, I know this day matters to you as well. I know you\u2019re tired of the bickering in Washington, frustrated by the negativity, and you just want us to use and focus on your needs, your concerns, and the conversations that are taking place at your kitchen table \u2014 conversation as profound as they are ordinary. \u00a0 How do I find work? And how do I get there? How can our small business thrive and our child succeed in school? Or how do we emerge from this pandemic not just with a little bit of breathing room, but with a real fighting chance to get ahead? \u00a0 When we ran for President, to help \u2014 I thought maybe I could help answer some of those questions for you and the needs you have. Because every time I\u2019d ride home on Amtrak, I\u2019d go through just north of \u2014 just south of Baltimore. I\u2019d look out as it would go through a suburban neighborhood. I\u2019d look in those \u2014 all those lights were on in the windows, Nance, and I\u2019d look and I\u2019d wonder, \u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d I\u2019m serious. I swear to God. \u201cWhat are they talking about sitting at that table? What are they talking about?\u201d \u00a0 They\u2019re talking about the things that I talked about at our kitchen table, Jill at hers, and all of you as well. Ask about, \u201cHow can we come together to be President for all Americans, to make sure our democracy delivers for you, for all of you?\u201d \u00a0 And I promised that we couldn\u2019t just build back to what it was before. We literally had to build back better. You couldn\u2019t build back \u2014 we\u2019re the only country that\u2019s always come out of great crises stronger than when we went in. \u00a0 And the world has changed, and we have to be ready. My fellow Americans, today, I want you to know: We hear you, and we see you. (Applause.) \u00a0 The bill I\u2019m about to sign into law is proof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results. (Applause.) \u00a0 We can do this. We can deliver real results for real people. We see in ways that really matter each and every day, to each person out there. And we\u2019re taking a monumental step forward to build back better as a nation. \u00a0 I want to thank everyone who helped make this happen: Vice President Harris, my Cabinet members, my White House team, Jill, Doug, our First Lady, and our \u2014 First Lady and our Second Husband. No, I\u2019m joking. (Laughter.) These guys travel all over the country together. I\u2019m getting worried, you know. (Laughter.) And Doug is one hell of a lawyer besides. \u00a0 And everybody from the United States Senate \u2014 Majority Leader Schumer and a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans have established this bipartisan framework, including representatives and all the folks you heard from. \u00a0 Senator Rob Portman is a really \u2014 hell of a good guy. I \u2014 I\u2019m not hurting you, Rob, because I know you\u2019re not running again. (Laughter.) That\u2019s the only reason I say it. But you are a hell of a good guy. \u00a0 And the most determined woman I know: Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Congratulations, Kyrsten. \u00a0 Look, Committee Chair Tom Carper, Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito. \u00a0 I also want to thank Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for voting for this bill and talking about how useful and important it is. \u00a0 And from the House of Representatives: Speaker Pelosi \u2014 (applause); Steny Hoyer \u2014 (applause); Jim Clyburn \u2014 (applause); and Committee Chair Pete DeFazio. (Applause.) Democrats and Republicans. Progressives and moderates. \u00a0 I\u2019d like to pause and ask all the committee chairs and ranking members of the United States Senate and House that are here today \u2014 please stand. Would all of you stand? Come on. (Applause.) All right. Thank you, thank you, thank you. \u00a0 To state the obvious, none of this would have happened without all of you. I really mean it. \u00a0 And also to the governors \u2014 where are the governors? Governors, stand up. Come on. I want you to stand up. (Applause.) Red states, blue states \u2014 you all contacted me. You all said you were for this. You all stepped up. \u00a0 And more than 375 mayors \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 (applause) \u2014 from every state and District of Columbia wrote me asking to get this done. \u00a0 AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) \u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: You got it, kid. \u00a0 AUDIENCE MEMBER: You got it. \u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) And nearly 50 of whom are here today, including Republican mayor of Fontana who \u2014 from Calif- \u2014 from Fontana \u2014 from Calif- \u2014 Fontana, California, Mayor Warren, who spoke earlier. \u00a0 And the county and state and Tribal leaders as well \u2014 civil rights leaders, faith leaders. Law \u2014 you know, this law was supported by business groups \u2014 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the National Association of Manufacturers; the Business Roundtable, representing 200 of the largest corporations in America and other top business. \u00a0 I want to especially thank \u2014 and I\u2019m sure you all \u2014 as we used to say in the Senate \u2013- I\u2019d say, \u201ca point of personal privilege\u201d \u2014 I want to thank organized labor \u2013- (applause) \u2013 who understand this about jobs. You all stood up. Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! \u00a0 Special thanks to the AFL-CIO; the United Auto Workers; electric workers, the IBEW; the iron workers \u2014 it goes on \u2014 plumbers, pipe fitters, and the building trades, steel workers, mach- \u2014 who did I leave out? \u00a0 AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) \u00a0 AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) \u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: Pardon me? \u00a0 AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) \u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: And my wife is a member of a union, the NEA. (Applause.) I\u2019m going to get in trouble. \u00a0 Machinists \u2014 so many more. \u00a0 Look folks, for too long, we\u2019ve talked about having the best economy in the world. We\u2019ve talked about asserting American leadership around the world with the best and the safest roads, railroads, ports, airports. \u00a0 Here in Washington, we\u2019ve heard countless speeches and promises and white papers from experts. But today, we\u2019re finally getting this done. (Applause.) \u00a0 So my message to the American people is this: America is moving again, and your life is going to change for the better. \u00a0 If you live in one of the top \u2014 if you live in one of the 10 million homes or your child attends one of the 400,000 schools or childcare centers that still has lead pipes in them, you face a clear and present danger to your child\u2019s health and your health now. \u00a0 This law is going to start to replace 100 percent of the nation\u2019s lead pipes and service lines \u2013- (applause) \u2014 so every American, every child can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. And tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters are going to get work done in good-paying jobs. \u00a0 Folks, as \u2014 as we saw with remote learning, remote working during the pandemic, access to high-speed Internet is essential \u2014 and access to water \u2014 as essential as access to water and electricity. \u00a0 This law is going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available everywhere \u2014 everywhere in America \u2014 urban suburban, rural \u2014 and create jobs laying down those broadband lines. \u00a0 No parent \u2014 no parent \u2014 (coughs) \u2014 excuse me \u2014 no parent should have to sit in a parking lot at a fast-food restaurant again just so their child can use the Internet to do their homework. That\u2019s over. (Applause.) \u00a0 And, folks, if I visited your town, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be able to tell me and \u2014 where you hold your breath as you cross the particular bridge or where the most dangerous intersection of your town is. \u00a0 This law makes this the most significant investment in roads and bridges in the past 70 years. It makes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years and in public transit ever. \u00a0 So, what \u2014 what that means is you\u2019re going to be safer, and you\u2019re going to get there faster, and we\u2019re going to have a whole hell of a lot pollution \u2014 less pollution in the air. \u00a0 The bipartisan law will modernize our ports, our airports, our freight rail to make it easier for companies to get goods to market; reduce supply chain bottlenecks, as we\u2019re experiencing now; and lower cost for you and your family. \u00a0 The law also builds on our resilience so that the next storm \u2014 superstorm, drought, wildfire, hurricane \u2014 can be dealt with. \u00a0 Last year alone, the United States, as a consequence of these kind of extreme weather events, lost $99 billion in the United States alone in damage. \u00a0 After Hurricane Ida \u2014 I see the distinguished governor from Louisiana is over there; I saw him stand up \u2014 I went down to see him. We went through and saw all the damage there. They had 179-mile-an-hour winds at top speed in Louisiana. \u00a0 But then I headed on up to New York \u2014 Chuck, up in your area \u2014 into Queens and New Jersey. More people died there than in a hurricane. More people died with the flooding. \u00a0 Record wildfires raged and went \u2014 I went to Idaho and California and saw it. More land has burned to the ground than the entire state of New Jersey out west. \u00a0 Folks \u2013- walk the neighborhoods and look the people in the eye in these circumstances, as many of you have, and you\u2019ll see the despair and the heartache. So many of you understand; you\u2019re living through it. \u00a0 This law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our levees better and stronger so few Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power in those days and weeks that comes with the storms that hit. \u00a0 Folks, this bipartisan law, for the first time ever, creates a true national network of charging stations for electric vehicles \u2014 over 500,000 of them \u2014 (applause) \u2014 so you can charge your car here and drive all the way to California not worrying about having to find places to charge, creating thousands of jobs \u2014 thousands. \u00a0 It is also going to make it possible for Americans to get off the sidelines and into the game of manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, batteries to store energy and power for electric vehicles, including electric school buses, which will mean millions of children will no longer inhale the dangerous diesel fumes that come out of the buses. (Applause.) \u00a0 For real. It\u2019s a big deal. \u00a0 And it\u2019ll reward companies for paying good wages and for buying American, sourcing their products here in America right now. \u00a0 It\u2019s going to help the United States export clean energy technologies to the world, creating mil- \u2014 tens of thousands of more jobs. \u00a0 There\u2019s so much more in the law, but, most of all, it does something truly historic. \u00a0 I ran for President believing it was time to rebuild the backbone of this nation, which I characterized as working people in the middle class \u2014 they\u2019re the ones who built the country \u2014 and to rebuild the economy from the bottom up in the middle out. \u00a0 This law delivers on that long-overdue promise, in my view. It creates better jobs for millions of Americans. And no one \u2014 no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny in federal taxes because of it. (Applause.) \u00a0 And it does not include \u2014 as we did the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, it does not include a single penny in gas tax, which I rejected because people under $400,000 would be paying it. \u00a0 This law is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. It leaves no one behind. And it makes \u2014 it marks an inflection point that we face as a nation. \u00a0 For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves. But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. We\u2019ve risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up. \u00a0 Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. Now, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world. Well, that\u2019s about to change. (Applause.) \u00a0 Things are going to turn around in a big way. For example, because of this law, next year will be the first year in 20 years American infrastructure investment will grow faster than China\u2019s. We\u2019ll once again have the best roads, bridges, ports, and airports over the next decade. And we\u2019ll lead the world into the 21st century with modern cars and trucks and transit systems. \u00a0 We\u2019re going to do this by building again and moving again. \u00a0 Folks, too often in Washington the reason we didn\u2019t get things done is because we insisted on getting everything we want \u2014 everything. \u00a0 With this law, we focus on getting things done. I ran for President because the only way to move this country forward, in my view, was through compromise and consensus. That\u2019s how the system works. That\u2019s American democracy. \u00a0 And I\u2019m going to be signing a law that is truly consequential because we made our democracy deliver for the American people. We compromised. We reached a consensus. That\u2019s necessary. \u00a0 And now, our focus moves to implementing an infrastructure law that\u2019s going to \u2014 with speed and with discipline. \u00a0 I have a lot of experience in doing that. When I was Vice President, I was given responsibility for overseeing and implementing the Recovery Act, a nearly $900 billion emergency package. \u00a0 I\u2019m proud to say that when we finished implementing that Recovery Act, it was determined that there had been less than two tenths of 1 percent waste, fraud, or abuse. \u00a0 And I was \u2014 it was how I learned and earned the nickname \u201cSheriff Joe\u201d from President Obama. Because I made it a point, every single day for well over a year, to stay on top of how the money was being used. \u00a0 I spoke with over 160 mayors \u2014 two, three times sometimes. And I spoke with county executives and every governor save one \u2014 I won\u2019t mention that; save one \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 she could see Alaska from her porch, but \u2014 monitor what we\u2019re doing, just how it was being done. \u00a0 And it was one of the most efficient implementations of a major program in American history. And now we owe it to the American people to do the same thing again. \u00a0 And to make sure every penny is spent where it\u2019s supposed to go in a timely fashion, I\u2019ve asked the former Mayor of New Orleans and former Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Mitch Landrieu, to oversee this responsibility. (Applause.) \u00a0 He\u2019ll have full access to every tool the federal government has to get it done. And we have \u2014 we have the high obligation and responsibility to make sure this money is used wisely and used well. \u00a0 Folks, I\u2019ve been looking forward to this day for a long time like all of my colleagues here have. \u00a0 Tomorrow, I\u2019ll be traveling to New Hampshire to visit a bridge that is structurally not safe, like thousands of bridges across America. That\u2019s what this law is all about: keeping communities safer and more efficient. \u00a0 On Wednesday, I\u2019ll be in Detroit to meet with the UAW workers who are building the next generation of electric vehicles. And that\u2019s just the beginning. \u00a0 We\u2019re also seeing me and the Vice \u2014 you\u2019ll be seeing me and the Vice President Harris, Jill and Doug, Cabinet officials hitting the road to help you understand how this is going to transform your lives for the better. \u00a0 And, folks, when you see those projects start in your hometowns, I want you to feel what I feel: pride \u2014 pride in what we can do together as the United States of America. \u00a0 Folks, you know, the same goes for my plan to build back better for the people \u2014 getting folks back to work and reducing costs of things like childcare, eldercare, housing, healthcare, prescription drugs, and meeting the moment on climate change. \u00a0 I\u2019m confident that the House will pass this bill, and then we\u2019re going to have to pass it in the Senate. And it\u2019s fully paid for. \u00a0 It will reduce the deficit over the long term, according to leading economists in the world. And again, no one earning less than $400,000 will pay a single penny more in federal taxes. \u00a0 And together \u2014 together with the infrastructure bill, millions of lives will be changed for the better. \u00a0 Folks, let me close with this: Throughout our history, we\u2019ve emerged from crises by investing in ourselves. \u00a0 During and after the Civil War, it\u2019s been referenced, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting East and West and uniting America. \u00a0 During the Cold War, we built the Interstate Highway System, transforming how America lived their lives. \u00a0 And now, we\u2019re emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we\u2019ll build an economy for the 21st century. \u00a0 When I met with the President of China \u2014 who I\u2019m going to be speaking with tonight \u2014 several years ago, he asked me \u2014 we were in China \u2014 he asked me \u2014 he said: Could I define America? And I said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d It\u2019s the God\u2019s truth. I said, \u201cAbsolutely. I can define it in one word: possibilities. Possibilities.\u201d \u00a0 There is no limit to what our people think we can do. And there is no limit to what our nation can do. And there is no one thing that I know more than this: It\u2019s never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never, never, never. (Applause.) \u00a0 Given half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let this nation down. And it\u2019s our job to give our people that chance. It\u2019s our job to come together and make sure we remain a nation of possibilities. \u00a0 As I look out on this crowd today, I see Democrats and Republicans, national leaders, local leaders, all elected officials, labor leaders, business leaders, and, most of all, I see fellow Americans. I see America. \u00a0 Let\u2019s remember this day. Let\u2019s remember we can come together. And most of all, let\u2019s remember what we got done for the American people when we do come together. \u00a0 I truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the moment America began to win the competition of the 21st century.\u201d \u00a0 So, with confidence, optimism, with vision and faith in each other, let\u2019s believe in possibilities. Let\u2019s believe in one another. And let\u2019s believe in America. \u00a0 God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. (Applause.) \u00a0 Now let me sign this bipartisan bill. (Applause.) \u00a0 (The bill is signed.) (Applause.) \u00a0 Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks, everybody. \u00a0 4:21 P.M. EST ",

        "intro": "As the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus spreads and cases and deaths increase\u00a0in the United States, President Joe Biden announces new efforts to fight the pandemic. He outlines\u00a0six broad areas of action--implementing new vaccination requirements, protecting the vaccinated with booster shots, keeping children safe and schools open, increasing testing and masking, protecting our economic recovery, and improving care of those who do get Covid-19.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow Americans. I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we\u2019ve made, and the work we have left to do. And it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 [sic] has\u2014COVID-19\u2014has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools. If we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19. It will take a lot of hard work, and it\u2019s going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free. You might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19. So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I\u2019m going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand. First, we have cons\u2014we have made considerable progress in battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection.\u00a0 Before I took office, we hadn\u2019t ordered enough vaccine for every American. Just weeks in office, we did. The week before I took office, on January 20th of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19. Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent. And in the three months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month. We\u2019re now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past three months. This progress is real. But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact. We\u2019re in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while. The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us. While the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks.\u00a0 This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it\u2019s caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.\u00a0 And to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they\u2019re ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable. Third, if you wonder how all this adds up, here\u2019s the math: The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing. Nearly three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter has not gotten any. That\u2019s nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinated. And in a country as large as ours, that\u2019s 25 percent minority. That 25 percent can cause a lot of damage\u2014and they are. The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack, or pancreitis [pancreatitis], or cancer. And fourth, I want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from COVID-19. I know there\u2019s a lot of confusion and misinformation. But the world\u2019s leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated, your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very low.\u00a0 In fact, based on available data from the summer, only one of out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day. These are the facts.\u00a0 So here\u2019s where we stand: The path ahead, even with the Delta variant, is not nearly as bad as last winter. But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is that we have the tools to combat COVID-19, and a distinct minority of Americans \u2013supported by a distinct minority of elected officials\u2014are keeping us from turning the corner. These pandemic politics, as I refer to, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die.\u00a0 We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal.\u00a0 As your President, I\u2019m announcing tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated, to combat those blocking public health.\u00a0 My plan also increases testing, protects our economy, and will make our kids safer in schools. It consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each that\u2014and each of those actions that you can read more about at WhiteHouse.gov. WhiteHouse.gov. The measures\u2014these are going to take time to have full impact. But if we implement them, I believe and the scientists indicate, that in the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses open. First, we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements. Of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated, many said they were waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administration\u2014the FDA. Well, last month, the FDA granted that approval. So, the time for waiting is over. This summer, we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives, as well as the FDA approval. Four million more people got their first shot in August than they did in July.\u00a0 But we need to do more. This is not about freedom or personal choice. It\u2019s about protecting yourself and those around you\u2014the people you work with, the people you care about, the people you love. My job as President is to protect all Americans.\u00a0 So, tonight, I\u2019m announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees, that together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week. Some of the biggest companies are already requiring this: United Airlines, Disney, Tysons Food, and even Fox News. The bottom line: We\u2019re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers. We\u2019re going to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America. My plan will extend the vaccination requirements that I previously issued in the healthcare field. Already, I\u2019ve announced, we\u2019ll be requiring vaccinations that all nursing home workers who treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid, because I have that federal authority. Tonight, I\u2019m using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals, home healthcare facilities, or other medical facilities\u2013a total of 17 million healthcare workers. If you\u2019re seeking care at a health facility, you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated. Simple. Straightforward. Period. Next, I will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinated\u2014all. And I\u2019ve signed another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the same. If you want to work with the federal government and do business with us, get vaccinated. If you want to do business with the federal government, vaccinate your workforce.\u00a0 And tonight, I\u2019m removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinated. The Department of Labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated. No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinated. Today, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans\u2014two thirds of all workers.\u00a0 And for other sectors, I issue this appeal: To those of you running large entertainment venues\u2014from sports arenas to concert venues to movie theaters\u2014please require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entry. And to the nation\u2019s family physicians, pediatricians, GPs\u2014general practitioners\u2014you\u2019re the most trusted medical voice to your patients. You may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated.\u00a0 Tonight, I\u2019m asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next two weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot. America needs your personal involvement in this critical effort. And my message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We\u2019ve made vaccinations free, safe, and convenient. The vaccine has FDA approval. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us. So, please, do the right thing. But just don\u2019t take it from me; listen to the voices of unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds, taking their final breaths, saying, \u201cIf only I had gotten vaccinated.\u201d \u201cIf only.\u201d It\u2019s a tragedy. Please don\u2019t let it become yours. The second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinated. For the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated, I understand your anger at those who haven\u2019t gotten vaccinated. I understand the anxiety about getting a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d case. But as the science makes clear, if you\u2019re fully vaccinated, you\u2019re highly protected from severe illness, even if you get COVID-19.\u00a0 In fact, recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day. You\u2019re as safe as possible, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to keep it that way\u2014keep it that way, keep you safe. That\u2019s where boosters come in\u2014the shots that give you even more protection than after your second shot. Now, I know there\u2019s been some confusion about boosters. So, let me be clear: Last month, our top government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated Americans. They believe that a booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yet. Of course, the decision of which booster shots to give, when to start them, and who will give them, will be left completely to the scientists at the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control. But while we wait, we\u2019ve done our part. We\u2019ve bought enough boosters\u2014enough booster shots\u2014and the distribution system is ready to administer them. As soon as they are authorized, those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of site across the\u2014sites across the country for most Americans, at your nearby drug store, and for free.\u00a0 The third piece of my plan is keeping\u2014and maybe the most important\u2014is keeping our children safe and our schools open. For any parent, it doesn\u2019t matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild. Trust me, I know.\u00a0 So, let me speak to you directly. Let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worries. It comes down to two separate categories: children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now, and children ages 11 and under who are not are yet eligible. The safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated. They get vaccinated for a lot of things. That\u2019s it. Get them vaccinated. As with adults, almost all the serious COVID-19 cases we\u2019re seeing among adolescents are in unvaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds\u2014an age group that lags behind in vaccination rates. So, parents, please get your teenager vaccinated. What about children under the age of 12 who can\u2019t get vaccinated yet? Well, the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home. Every parent, every teen sibling, every caregiver around them should be vaccinated.\u00a0 Children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a state with low vaccination rates rather than the states with high vaccination rates.\u00a0 Now, if you\u2019re a parent of a young child, you\u2019re wondering when will it be\u2014when will it be\u2014the vaccine available for them. I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12. We can\u2019t take shortcuts with that scientific work.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible, and our nation\u2019s top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can plan. Now to the schools. We know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measures\u2014like testing, masking, adequate ventilation systems that we provided the money for, social distancing, and vaccinations\u2014then children can be safe from COVID-19 in schools. Today, about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated. We should get that to 100 percent. My administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the Defense Department\u2014because I have the authority as President in the federal system\u2014the Defense Department and the Interior Department\u2014to get vaccinated. That\u2019s authority I possess.\u00a0 Tonight, I\u2019m announcing that we\u2019ll require all of nearly 300,000 educators in the federal paid program, Head Start program, must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngest\u2014our youngest\u2014most precious Americans and give parents the comfort. And tonight, I\u2019m calling on all governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff. Some already have done so, but we need more to step up.\u00a0 Vaccination requirements in schools are nothing new. They work. They\u2019re overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions. And to all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children: I\u2019ll always be on your side.\u00a0 Let me be blunt. My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions. Right now, local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs. Talk about bullying in schools. If they\u2019ll not help\u2014if these governors won\u2019t help us beat the pandemic, I\u2019ll use my power as President to get them out of the way.\u00a0 The Department of Education has already begun to take legal action against states undermining protection that local school officials have ordered. Any teacher or school official whose pay is withheld for doing the right thing, we will have that pay restored by the federal government 100 percent. I promise you I will have your back.\u00a0 The fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking. From the start, America has failed to do enough COVID-19 testing. In order to better detect and control the Delta variant, I\u2019m taking steps tonight to make testing more available, more affordable, and more convenient. I\u2019ll use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, including those that you can use at home.\u00a0 While that production is ramping up, my administration has worked with top retailers, like Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger\u2019s, and tonight we\u2019re announcing that, no later than next week, each of these outlets will start to sell at-home rapid test kits at cost for the next three months. This is an immediate price reduction for at-home test kits for up to 35 percent reduction. We\u2019ll also expand\u2014expand free testing at 10,000 pharmacies around the country. And we\u2019ll commit\u2014we\u2019re committing $2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers, food banks, schools, so that every American, no matter their income, can access free and convenient tests. This is important to everyone, particularly for a parent or a child\u2014with a child not old enough to be vaccinated. You\u2019ll be able to test them at home and test those around them. In addition to testing, we know masking helps stop the spread of COVID-19. That\u2019s why when I came into office, I required masks for all federal buildings and on federal lands, on airlines, and other modes of transportation.\u00a0 Today\u2014tonight, I\u2019m announcing that the Transportation Safety Administration\u2014the TSA\u2014will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules, be prepared to pay.\u00a0 And, by the way, show some respect. The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong; it\u2019s ugly.\u00a0 The fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery. Because of our vaccination program and the American Rescue Plan, which we passed early in my administration, we\u2019ve had record job creation for a new administration, economic growth unmatched in 40 years. We cannot let unvaccinated do this progress\u2014undo it, turn it back.\u00a0 So tonight, I\u2019m announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery. We\u2019ll be expanding COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs. That\u2019s a program that\u2019s going to allow small businesses to borrow up to $2 million from the current $500,000 to keep going if COVID-19 impacts on their sales.\u00a0 These low-interest, long-term loans require no repayment for two years and be can used to hire and retain workers, purchase inventory, or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began. I\u2019ll also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic.\u00a0 Sixth, we\u2019re going to continue to improve the care of those who do get COVID-19. In early July, I announced the deployment of surge response teams. These are teams comprised of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, the Defense Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014FEMA\u2014to areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0 Since then, the federal government has deployed nearly 1,000 staff, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, into 18 states. Today, I\u2019m announcing that the Defense Department will double the number of military health teams that they\u2019ll deploy to help their fellow Americans in hospitals around the country.\u00a0 Additionally, we\u2019re increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors, not conspir-\u2014conspiracy theorists. The monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing sefe-\u2014severe disease.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already distributed 1.4 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals. Tonight, I\u2019m announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50 percent. Before I close, let me say this: Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus. And as we continue to battle COVID-19, we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response. We\u2019ll ensure that everyone is reached. My first responsibility as President is to protect the American people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every American, including enough boosters for every American who\u2019s approved to get one.\u00a0 We also know this virus transcends borders. That\u2019s why, even as we execute this plan at home, we need to continue fighting the virus overseas, continue to be the arsenal of vaccines.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries, more than all other countries combined, including Europe, China, and Russia combined. That\u2019s American leadership on a global stage, and that\u2019s just the beginning. We\u2019ve also now started to ship another 500 million COVID vaccines\u2014Pfizer vaccines\u2014purchased to donate to 100 lower-income countries in need of vaccines. And I\u2019ll be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this month. As I recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isn\u2019t caught flat-footed when a new pandemic comes again\u2014as it will\u2014next month, I\u2019m also going to release the plan in greater detail. So let me close with this: We have so-\u2014we\u2019ve made so much progress during the past seven months of this pandemic. The recent increases in vaccinations in August already are having an impact in some states where case counts are dropping in recent days. Even so, we remain at a critical moment, a critical time. We have the tools. Now we just have to finish the job with truth, with science, with confidence, and together as one nation. Look, we\u2019re the United States of America. There\u2019s nothing\u2014not a single thing\u2014we\u2019re unable to do if we do it together. So let\u2019s stay together. God bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this pandemic. And may God protect our troops. Get vaccinated. ",

        "intro": "On August 26, 2021, a suicide bomber set off explosives at the\u00a0Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing 13 US service members and dozens of Afghan civilians. The terrorist group, ISIS-K, later claimed responsibility for the attack. President Joe Biden responds to the situation by reiterating his commitment to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. In response to the attack, the president vows, \"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.\" He then answers questions from the press.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Been a tough day. This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked\u2014that we\u2019ve been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed\u00a0has\u00a0[was] undertaken\u2014an attack\u2014by a group known as ISIS-K\u2014took the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well. I\u2019ve been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you\u2019ve had a chance to speak to some, so far. The situation on the ground is still evolving, and I\u2019m constantly being updated. These American service members who gave their lives\u2014it\u2019s an overused word, but it\u2019s totally appropriate\u2014they were heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others. They were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out. They were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the \u201cbackbone of America.\u201d They\u2019re the spine of America, the best the country has to offer. Jill and I\u2014our hearts ache, like I\u2019m sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we\u2019re outraged as well as heartbroken. Being the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war\u2014when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain\u2014who we lost.\u00a0 We have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there\u2019s no way out. My heart aches for you. But I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you\u2014the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever. The lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America. Like their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of\u2014the fallen this day, they\u2019re part of a great and noble company of American heroes. To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command. Over the past few weeks\u2014I know you\u2019re\u2014many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it\u2014we\u2019ve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K\u2014an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened\u2014has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others. This is why, from the outset, I\u2019ve repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission. And as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed\u2014this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We\u2019ve known that from the beginning. And as I\u2019ve been in constant contact with our senior military leaders\u2014and I mean constant, around the clock\u2014and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve ordered them to do. We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation. I\u2019ve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.\u00a0 Here is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on.\u00a0 America will not be intimidated.\u00a0 I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan. Every day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need\u2014what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request.\u00a0 I reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul. And I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon, and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives. Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, \u201cWhom shall I send\u2026who shall go for us?\u201d And the American military has been answering for a long time: \u201cHere am I, Lord. Send me.\u201d \u201cHere I am. Send me.\u201d Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm\u2019s way, to risk everything\u2014not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love. And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform\u2014military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion. (A moment of silence is taken.) Thank you. May God bless you all. And may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It\u2019s within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast.\u00a0 We will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them and we will get them out.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O\u2019Donnell of NBC. Q Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today\u2019s attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are you\u2014are you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation? THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ve instructed the military, whatever they need\u2014if they need additional force\u2014I will grant it. But the military\u2014from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the field\u2014have all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others.\u00a0 And with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they are\u2014not certain\u2014and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them. Q: Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Wherever they are. Trevor from Reuters. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard? THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we\u2019re in a situation\u2014we inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days before\u2014in 11 days\u2014that it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it\u2019s in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target.\u00a0 As a consequence of that, the major things we\u2019ve asked them\u2014moving back the perimeter; give me more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming through\u2014it is not what you\u2019d call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. is\u2014the military is\u2014but they\u2019re acting in their interest\u2014their interest. And so, by and large\u2014and I\u2019ve asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it\u2019s a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we\u2019re just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it\u2019s in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can. And like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out; over 5,000 Americans overall. So, it\u2019s not a matter of trust, it\u2019s a matter of mutual self-interest. And\u2014but there is no evidence thus far that I\u2019ve been given, as a consequence by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue for\u2014beyond today. Aamer, Associated Press. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mind\u2014and also what you\u2019ve said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attack\u2014how do you weigh staying even one more day, considering what\u2019s happened? THE PRESIDENT: Because I think what America says matters. What we say we\u2019re going to do and the context in which we say we\u2019re going to do it, that we do it\u2014unless something exceptional changes. There are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women\u2019s groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out. And our military\u2014and, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attack\u2014the military has concluded that\u2019s what we should do. I think they\u2019re right. I think they\u2019re correct. And after that, we\u2019re going to be in a circumstance where there are\u2014will be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban. They\u2019re not good guys, the Taliban. I\u2019m not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don\u2019t have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been. And so there\u2019s a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them. Now, there\u2019s not many left that we can assess that are\u2014want to come out. There\u2019s some Americans we\u2019ve identified\u2014we\u2019ve contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of them\u2014who don\u2019t want to leave because they have sig-\u2014they\u2019re dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there\u2019s others who are looking for the time. So, that\u2019s why we continue. I\u2019ll take a few more questions, and\u2014but, you, sir. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t pick you, but that\u2019s okay. (Laughs.) Q: I wanted to ask you\u2014you say that \u201cwhat America says matters.\u201d What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31st? What \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I say \u2014 Q: What do you say to them? THE PRESIDENT:\u2014we\u2019re going to continue to try to get you out. It matters. Look, I know of no conflict, as a student of history\u2014no conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out.\u00a0 And think about it, folks. I think it\u2019s important for\u2014I know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they\u2019d be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice. So, getting every single person out is\u2014can\u2019t be guaranteed to anybody because there\u2019s a determination, all who wants to get out as well. At any rate, it\u2019s a process. I was really pointing to you, but\u2014you, sir. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen? And then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold, or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base? THE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done on the\u2014ask this\u2014I\u2019ll answer the last question, first.\u00a0 On the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan\u2014the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission. They concluded\u2014the military\u2014that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so, I followed that recommendation.\u00a0 With regard to\u2014there are certain circumstances where we\u2019ve gotten information\u2014and quite frankly, sometimes from some of you\u2014saying, \u201cYou know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out and they\u2019re on a bus, they\u2019re moving\u2026\u201d\u2014from other people\u2014\u201cand this is their location.\u201d And there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, \u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cThis bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through.\u201d\u00a0 So, yes, there have been occasions like that.\u00a0 And to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred\u2014they\u2019ve been let through. But I can\u2019t tell you with any certitude that there\u2019s actually been a list of names. I don\u2019t\u2014there may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not\u2014it didn\u2019t exist, that, \u201cHere\u2019s the names of 12 people; they\u2019re coming. Let them through.\u201d It could very well have happened.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take one more question. Q: Mr. President, can I \u2014 Q: Mr. President, right here. Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press.\u00a0 Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Is that\u2014is there\u2014thank you. THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s you. (Laughter.) Q: Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 Marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks? THE PRESIDENT: I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that\u2019s happened of late. But here\u2019s the deal: You know\u2014I wish you\u2019d one day say these things\u2014you know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1. In return, the commitment was made\u2014and that was a year before\u2014in return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces.\u00a0 Remember that? I\u2019m being serious.\u00a0 Q: Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, I\u2014I\u2019m asking you a question. Be a\u2014because before I \u2014 Q: Donald Trump is not the President right now. THE PRESIDENT: No, no\u2014now wait a minute. I\u2019m asking you a question. Is that\u2014is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge? Q: I know what you\u2019re talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully\u2014 THE PRESIDENT: What? Q:\u2014since\u2014I don\u2019t think that the issue that\u2014do you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan, or just the way that things have happened?\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurt\u2014some, as we\u2019ve seen, have gotten killed\u2014and that it is messy. The reason why\u2014whether my friend will acknowledge it and was\u2014reported it\u2014the reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: \u201cI will be out by May 1st. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans.\u201d That was the deal. That\u2019s why no American was attacked. Q: And you said that you still\u2014a few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folks\u2014and I\u2019m going to\u2014I have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we\u2019d be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there. I\u2019d have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relative\u2014is why the reason we went in the first place. I have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan\u2014a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country, and is made up\u2014and I don\u2019t mean this in a derogatory\u2014made up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another. And so, as I said before\u2014and this is the last comment I\u2019ll make, but we\u2019ll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we\u2019re not out yet\u2014if Osama bin Laden, as well as al Qaeda, had chosen to launch an attack\u2014when they left Saudi Arabia\u2014out of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone? I know it\u2019s not fair to ask you questions. It\u2019s rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded. Our interest in going was to prevent al Qaeda from reemerging\u2014first to get bin Laden, wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again. As I\u2019ve said 100 times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have military encampments there; we don\u2019t keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us.\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war. Thank you so much. ",

He acknowledges how painful the situation is after twenty years of US involvement, but stands by his decision.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan: the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps we\u2019re taking to address the rapidly evolving events. My national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency, including\u2014and contingency\u2014including the rapid collapse we\u2019re seeing now. I\u2019ll speak more in a moment about the specific steps we\u2019re taking, but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what America\u2019s interests are in Afghanistan. We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again. We did that. We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and we got him. That was a decade ago.\u00a0 Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy. Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland. I\u2019ve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism\u2014not counterinsurgency or nation building. That\u2019s why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice President. And that\u2019s why, as President, I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021\u2014not yesterday\u2019s threats. Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan: al Shabaab in Somalia, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. These threats warrant our attention and our resources. We conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don\u2019t have a permanent military presence. If necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed. When I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021\u2014just a little over three months after I took office. U.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001. The choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season. There would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1. There was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict.\u00a0 I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I\u2019ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces. That\u2019s why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency. But I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated. So what\u2019s happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight. If anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision.\u00a0 American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong\u2014incredibly well equipped\u2014a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies.\u00a0 We gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force\u2014something the Taliban doesn\u2019t have. Taliban does not have an air force. We provided close air support.\u00a0 We gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future. There\u2019s some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers, but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now, there is no chance that 1 year\u20141 more year, 5 more years, or 20 more years of U.S. military boots on the ground would\u2019ve made any difference. And here\u2019s what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan\u2019s own armed forces would not. If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people, unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down, they would never have done so while U.S. troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for them. And our true strategic competitors\u2014China and Russia\u2014would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely. When I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations. We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the U.S. military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically.\u00a0 They failed to do any of that. I also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong. So I\u2019m left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America\u2019s daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans\u2014Afghanistan\u2019s civil war when Afghan troops will not?\u00a0 How many more lives\u2014American lives\u2014is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery? I\u2019m clear on my answer: I will not repeat the mistakes we\u2019ve made in the past\u2014the mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States, of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country, of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of U.S. forces. Those are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat, because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignore. I also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us. The scenes we\u2019re seeing in Afghanistan, they\u2019re gut-wrenching, particularly for our veterans, our diplomats, humanitarian workers, for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan people. For those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the country\u2014serve our country in Afghanistan\u2014this is deeply, deeply personal. It is for me as well. I\u2019ve worked on these issues as long as anyone. I\u2019ve been throughout Afghanistan during this war\u2014while the war was going on\u2014from Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar Valley. I\u2019ve traveled there on four different occasions. I met with the people. I\u2019ve spoken to the leaders. I spent time with our troops. And I came to understand firsthand what was and was not possible in Afghanistan. So, now we\u2019re fercus [sic]\u2014focused on what is possible.\u00a0 We will continue to support the Afghan people. We will lead with our diplomacy, our international influence, and our humanitarian aid. We\u2019ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability. We\u2019ll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people\u2014of women and girls\u2014just as we speak out all over the world. I have been clear that human rights must be the center of our foreign policy, not the periphery. But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments; it\u2019s with our diplomacy, our economic tools, and rallying the world to join us.\u00a0 Now, let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan. I was asked to authorize\u2014and I did\u20146,000 U.S. troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of U.S. and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan, and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of Afghanistan. Our troops are working to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flights. We\u2019re taking over air traffic control.\u00a0 We have safely shut down our embassy and transferred our diplomats. Our dip-\u2014our diplomatic presence is now consolidated at the airport as well. Over the coming days, we intend to transport out thousands of American citizens who have been living and working in Afghanistan. We\u2019ll also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnel\u2014the civilian personnel of our Allies who are still serving in Afghanistan. Operation Allies Refugee [Refuge], which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigration Visas and their families to the United States. In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan. We\u2019re also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy: U.S. non-governmental agencies\u2014or the U.S. non-governmental organizations; and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk; and U.S. news agencies. I know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans\u2014civilians sooner. Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier\u2014still hopeful for their country. And part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering, as they said, \u201ca crisis of confidence.\u201d American troops are performing this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do, but it is not without risks. As we carry out this departure, we have made it clear to the Taliban: If they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation, the U.S. presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful. We will defend our people with devastating force if necessary. Our current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in its objectives: Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible.\u00a0 And once we have completed this mission, we will conclude our military withdrawal. We will end America\u2019s longest war after 20 long years of bloodshed. The events we\u2019re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, and secure Afghanistan\u2014as known in history as the \u201cgraveyard of empires.\u201d What is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future. We have to be honest: Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many missteps\u2014made many missteps over the past two decades.\u00a0 I\u2019m now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistan\u2014two Democrats and two Republicans. I will not pass this responsibly on\u2014responsibility on to a fifth President. I will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference. Nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we are today and how we must move forward from here. I am President of the United States of America, and the buck stops with me. I am deeply saddened by the facts we now face. But I do not regret my decision to end America\u2019s warfighting in Afghanistan and maintain a laser-focus on our counterterrorism missions there and in other parts of the world. Our mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and kill Osama bin Laden was a success. Our decades-long effort to overcome centuries of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan was not, and I wrote and believed it never could be. I cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in another\u2014in another country\u2019s civil war, taking casualties, suffering life-shattering injuries, leaving families broken by grief and loss. This is not in our national security interest. It is not what the American people want. It is not what our troops, who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades, deserve. I made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring America\u2019s military involvement in Afghanistan to an end. And while it\u2019s been hard and messy\u2014and yes, far from perfect\u2014I\u2019ve honored that commitment. More importantly, I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this nation that I wasn\u2019t going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago.\u00a0 Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man. I will not do it in Afghanistan. I know my decision will be criticized, but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United States\u2014yet another one\u2014a fifth one.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s the right one\u2014it\u2019s the right decision for our people. The right one for our brave service members who have risked their lives serving our nation. And it\u2019s the right one for America.\u00a0 So, thank you. May God protect our troops, our diplomats, and all of the brave Americans serving in harm\u2019s way. ",

        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan. When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we\u2019re on track to meet that target. Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart. Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown. And in this context, speed is safety. And thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one\u2014no one U.S. forces or any forces have\u2014have been lost. Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with an increased risk of safety to our personnel. To me, those risks were unacceptable. And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism. That\u2019s what they do. And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supported\u2014we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde. I want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August. We remain\u2014we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority\u2014excuse me, the same authority under which we\u2019ve been operating for some time. As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That\u2019s why we went. We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it\u2019s the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country. Together, with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hu-\u2014nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military\u2014of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving. Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades. We provided our Afghan partners with all the tools\u2014let me emphasize: all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military. We provided advanced weaponry. And we\u2019re going to continue to provide funding and equipment. And we\u2019ll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force. But most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve. In our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure. We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls. I intend to maintain our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport. And we\u2019re going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence. I\u2019ve asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution. To be clear\u2014to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement. We\u2019ll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well. We\u2019re going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark\u2014excuse me\u2014Fre\u2013 Frerichs\u2014I want to pronounce the name correctly; I mis-\u2014I misspoke\u2014so that he can return to his family safely. We\u2019re also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators\u2014since we\u2019re no longer going to have military there after this; we\u2019re not going to need them and they have no jobs\u2014who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they\u2014and they\u2019ve been very vital\u2014and so their families are not exposed to danger as well. We\u2019ve already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States. Since I was inaugurated on January 20th, we\u2019ve already approved 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States. Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that. Half have gotten on aircraft and com\u2014commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay\u2014at least thus far. We\u2019re working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas. And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed. The operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they ch-\u2014if they so choose. And, starting this month, we\u2019re going to begin to re-\u2014re-\u2014reloc-\u2014we\u2019re going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave. We have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts. But our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us. When I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely. I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates. But for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history. In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014. In 2014, some argued, \u201cOne more year.\u201d So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties. In 2015, the same. And on and on. Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that \u201cjust one more year\u201d of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely. It\u2019s up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country. Others are more direct. Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan\u2014in Afghanistan indefinitely. In doing so, they point to the fact that we\u2014we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal. But that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest mil-\u2014is at its strongest militarily since 2001. The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum. And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the\u2014with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past\u2014of this year. That\u2019s what I inherited. That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces. If, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back\u2014going back on that agreement made by the last administration\u2014[that] the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future\u2014the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces. The status quo was not an option. Staying would have meant U.S. troops taking casualties; American men and women back in the middle of a civil war. And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops. Once that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible. So let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more\u2014how many thousands more of America\u2019s daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay? Already we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago. Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well? Would you send your own son or daughter? After 20 years\u2014a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health\u2014I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome. The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago. We need to meet the threats where they are today. Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. So, we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. But make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan. We are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed. And we also need to focus on shoring up America\u2019s core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine\u2014determine our future. We have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we\u2019re better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat. We need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergenc-\u2014emerging technologies. We need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change. And we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years. Finally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan. I want to honor the significance of what they\u2019ve accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet\u2014and I\u2019ve been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn\u2019t been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out Bin Laden. I want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given, and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war. We\u2019ll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country. We\u2019re ending America\u2019s longest war, but we\u2019ll always, always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Q: Mr. President\u2014do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Q: Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable? THE PRESIDENT: No, it is not. Q: Why? THE PRESIDENT: Because you\u2014the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped\u2014as well-equipped as any army in the world\u2014and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable. Q: Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Do you trust the Taliban, sir? THE PRESIDENT: You\u2014is that a serious question? Q: It is absolutely a serious question. Do you trust the Taliban? THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not. Q: Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban? THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not trust the Taliban. Q: So why are you handing the country over? Q: Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country? Q: Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please? Will you amplify your answer, please\u2014why you don\u2019t trust the Taliban? THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a silly question. Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more re-\u2014more competent in terms of conducting war.Yes, ma\u2019am. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it? THE PRESIDENT: You know my record. I can tell by the way you asked the question. I opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan. I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall\u2014it came to light after the administration was over, last\u2014our administration\u2014no nation has ever unified Afghanistan. No nation. Empires have gone there and not done it. The focus we had\u2014and I strongly support it\u2014and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan. I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was\u2014allegedly escaped or\u2014out of harm\u2019s way. We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time. The second reason was to eliminate al Qaeda\u2019s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives\u2014period. That\u2019s what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan. That job had been over for some time. And that\u2019s why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue. Q: Mr. President, has the civilian government hailed the people of Afghanistan? Q: Mr. President, thank you very much. Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse. THE PRESIDENT: That is not true. Q: Is it\u2014can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not? THE PRESIDENT: That is not true. They did not\u2014they didn\u2019t\u2014did not reach that conclusion. Q: So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse? THE PRESIDENT: The Afghan government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It\u2019s not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment. The question is: Will they do it? And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus-\u2014walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force. We are. We\u2019re going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in\u2014in the region. But\u2014but, there\u2019s not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban. I believe the only way there\u2019s going to be\u2014this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community\u2014the only way there\u2019s ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace. And the likelihood there\u2019s going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely. Q: Mr. President, thank you. But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller. He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it? THE PRESIDENT: Look, you\u2019ve said two things\u2014one, that if it could result in a civil war\u2014that\u2019s different than the Taliban succeeding, number one. Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated\u2014is going to implicate the entire region as well. There\u2019s a number of countries who have a grave concern about what\u2019s going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security. The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That\u2019s when that judgement will be made. Q: Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan. Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: None whatsoever. Zero. What you had is\u2014you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy\u2014six, if I\u2019m not mistaken. The Taliban is not the south\u2014the North Vietnamese army. They\u2019re not\u2014they\u2019re not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There\u2019s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy in the\u2014of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable. Q: And, Mr. President \u2014 Q: Mr. President, can I \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll take him and then I\u2019ll\u2014and then I\u2019ll go\u2014I\u2019ll go to the other side. Hang on a second. Q: Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing there? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, the mission hasn\u2019t failed, yet. There is in Afghanistan\u2014in all parties, there\u2019s been corruption. The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose? What is the objective? For example, it started off\u2014there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government. That\u2014that of\u2014it didn\u2019t come to\u2014it didn\u2019t come to fruition. So the question now is, where do they go from here? That\u2014the jury is still out. But the likelihood there\u2019s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely. Yes, ma\u2019am. Q: Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No. Q:\u2014military exit? THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no. It\u2019s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them. No country has ever been able to do that. Keep in mind, as a student of history, as I\u2019m sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history. Not in all of its history. Q: Mr. President, if this isn\u2019t a \u201cmission accomplished\u201d moment, what is it, in your view? THE PRESIDENT: No, there\u2019s no \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d Q: How would you describe it? THE PRESIDENT: The mission was accomplished in that we get\u2014got Osama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world. Q: Mr. President, if \u201cspeed is safety,\u201d as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals? Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end? THE PRESIDENT: Well, much of it has already happened. There\u2019s already been people\u2014about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home\u2014come to the United States already on commercial aircraft. So, as I said, there\u2019s over 2,500 people that as\u2014from January to now, have gotten those visas. And only half decided that they wanted to leave. The point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas. Q: Why can\u2019t the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do? THE PRESIDENT: Because the law doesn\u2019t allow that to happen. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking the Congress to consider changing the law. But in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to\u2014to\u2014and hopefully, while they\u2019re waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that\u2019s what they choose to do. Q: And what do you make\u2014and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today? Q: Mr. President, I\u2019m from Afghanistan. I am Afghan (inaudible) woman. Any message\u2014good message for Afghan women in future? Because they have achievement\u2014they are really concerned about their achievement. THE PRESIDENT: They are very concerned, with good reason. Q: Yes. THE PRESIDENT: When I was in Afghanistan\u2014I\u2019ve been there a number of times\u2014I remember being in a school outside and\u2014and, by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, a\u2014an area in the middle that is sort of like\u2014it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it. And I remember saying to\u2014speaking to a group of young women\u2014I guess they were roughly\u2014don\u2019t hold me to this\u2014they look like they\u2019d be 14, 15 years old. And they\u2019re in school, and there\u2019s a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know. And I said, \u201cYou know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and that terrorists didn\u2019t amass again to\u2014to go after our country. And then we\u2019re going to have to leave.\u201d And a young woman said, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave. You can\u2019t leave.\u201d It was\u2014it was heartbreaking. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. If you leave, I\u2019ll never be able to be a doctor.\u201d Well, that\u2019s why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that. If every work \u2014 Well, anyway\u2014so, yes, I\u2019m aware. I\u2019m going to take one more question. Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal? Q: (Inaudible) the Taliban being in Russia today\u2014the Taliban \u2014 Q: Mr.\u2014Mr. President, I\u2014thank you. I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you\u2019ve spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you\u2019ve seen in 20 years. How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent there? THE PRESIDENT: Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they\u2019re not even close in terms of their capacity. I was making the point\u2014the point was that here we were; I was\u2014the argument is, \u201cWell, we could stay because no one was dying. No Americans are being shot. So why leave?\u201d Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before. Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, the government. More than they were. The point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren\u2019t going to go after them. That was the point I was making. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. ",

        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, sit down. And I got to make one check here. (The President leaves the podium to greet audience members.) (The President returns to the podium.) I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over. (Laughter.) Imagine how excited you\u2019d be when you\u2019re\u2014four? Five? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Almost five. THE PRESIDENT: Almost five years old, coming to hear a President speak. (Laughter.) My Lord. In my faith, we call that purgatory. (Laughter.)\u00a0 Lauren, thank you for that gracious introduction. And in case you were wondering, I\u2014in Delaware\u2014we\u2019re a small state\u2014we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented members of Congress. And so if I didn\u2019t walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswoman\u2014(applause)\u2014immediately, that was \u2014 How are you, Rev? Good to see you. We\u2019ve got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what\u2019s happening here. And to all of the descendants here today, and to the community and civil rights leaders, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget. You know, there\u2019s a verse in First Corinthians that says, \u201cFor now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully.\u201d It is\u2014I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here. And\u2014(applause)\u2014I mean that sincerely. Thank you. And if I didn\u2019t say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back. (Laughter.) I apologize. But the tour\u2014in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who\u2019s only 56 [107] years old. (Laughter.) God love her. And Mother Fletcher, who\u2019s 67 [106] years old. (Laughter.) And her brother\u2014her brother, Van Ellis, who\u2019s 100 years old. (Laughter.) And he looks like he\u2019s 60. Thank you for spending so much time with me. I really mean it. It was a great honor. A genuine honor. You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly. But no longer. Now your story will be known in full view. The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago. And yet, I\u2019m the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa\u2014(applause)\u2014I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it\u2014a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time, and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here. For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent, it doesn\u2019t mean that it did not take place. And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. It erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can\u2019t be buried, no matter how hard people try. And so it is here. Only\u2014only with truth can come healing and justice and repair. Only with truth, facing it. But that isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0 First, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis. (Applause.) To all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full. May 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa\u2014a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier. On the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy\u2014worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood\u2014a community, a way of life. Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools. Black veterans, like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to, who fought\u2014volunteered and fought, and came home and still faced such prejudice. (Applause.) Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and\u2014they were, at the time\u2014mom-and-plack [sic]\u2014mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors\u2014the things that make up a community. At the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love. Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink. Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford. All around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end. Mother Randle was just six years old\u2014six years old\u2014living with her grandmom. She said she was lucky to have a home and toys, and fortunate to live without fear. Mother Fletcher was seven years old, the second of seven children. The youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old. The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth\u2014not real wealth, but a different wealth\u2014a wealth in culture and community and heritage. (Applause.)\u00a0 But one night\u2014one night changed everything. Everything changed. While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside. It wasn\u2019t everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community. Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal\u2014Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans. A belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose.\u00a0 And it speaks to that\u2014lit the fuse. It lit it by the spark that it provided\u2014a fuse of fury\u2014was an innocent interaction that turned into an in-\u2014a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenager. A white mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night. But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard.\u00a0 Words were exchanged. Then a scuffle. Then shots fired. Hell was unleashed. Literal hell was unleashed.\u00a0 Through the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood. Torches and guns. Shooting at will. A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off. A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside. An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads. Private planes\u2014private planes\u2014dropping explosives\u2014the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa. Eight of Greenwood\u2019s nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion\u2014across the street, at Vernon AME. Mother Randle said it was like war. Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around. The Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton [sic]\u2014excuse me\u2014Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night. And here\u2019s the poem. He said, \u201cKill them, burn them, set the pace\u2026 teach them how to keep their place. Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night.\u201d That\u2019s what he remembered in the poem that he wrote. One hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble. Less than 24 hours\u2014in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost. Insurance companies\u2014they had insurance, many of them\u2014rejected claims of damage. Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps. As I was told today, they were told, \u201cDon\u2019t you mention you were ever in a camp or we\u2019ll come and get you.\u201d That\u2019s what survivors told me. Yet no one\u2014no arrests of the mob were made. None. No proper accounting of the dead. The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people. That\u2019s all. Thirty-six people. But based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood\u2014the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves. Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure. But, you know, as we speak, the process\u2014the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started. And at this moment, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood. They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect. May their souls rest in peace. [Pause for a moment of silence.] My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre\u2014(applause)\u2014among the worst in our history, but not the only one. And for too long, forgotten by our history. As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory\u2014our collective memories\u2014from the news and everyday conversations. For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn\u2019t even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere. And most people didn\u2019t realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded\u2014the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded. A friend of mine, Jon Meacham\u2014I had written\u2014when I said I was running to restore the soul of America, he wrote a book called \u201cThe Soul of America\u201d\u2014not because of what I said. And there\u2019s a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend\u2014pointed hats, the robes\u2014marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Jesse, you know all about this. Washin-\u2014Washington, D.C. If my memory is correct, there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan. There were five, if I\u2019m not mistaken\u2014it could have been seven; I think it was five\u2014members of the United States Senate\u2014open members of the Klan. Multiple governors who were open members of the Klan. Most people didn\u2019t realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa. And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic. It wasn\u2019t about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute Christianity. The flames from those burning crosses torched every region\u2014region of the country. Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren\u2019t even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it. And that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture. We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn\u2019t impact us today, because it does still impact us today. We can\u2019t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. (Applause.) We should know the good, the bad, everything. That\u2019s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides. And we\u2019re a great nation. The only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild. I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen. (Applause.) And only\u2014as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal. We just have to choose to remember. We memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be \u2013so it can\u2019t be erased. We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can\u2019t bury pain and trauma forever. And at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we\u2019re facing right now as a nation. What many people hadn\u2019t seen before or ha-\u2014or simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer. You see it in so many places.\u00a0 And there\u2019s greater recognition that, for too long, we\u2019ve allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester\u2014the view that America is a zero-sum game where there is only one winner. \u201cIf you succeed, I fail. If you get ahead, I fall behind. If you get a job, I lose mine.\u201d And maybe worst of all, \u201cIf I hold you down, I lift myself up,\u201d instead of \u201cIf you do well, we all do well.\u201d (Applause.) We see that in Greenwood. This story isn\u2019t about the loss of life, but a loss of living, of wealth and prosterity [prosperity] and possibilities that still reverberates today. Mother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker. Mr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War Two, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America. Imagine all those hotels and dinners [diners] and mom-and-pop shops that could been\u2014have been passed down this past hundred years. Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth. If you come from backgrounds like my\u2014my family\u2014a working-class, middle-class family\u2014the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes. Imagine what they contributed then and what they could\u2019ve contributed all these years. Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would\u2019ve meant for all of Tulsa, including the white community. While the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn\u2019t last. Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships. (Applause.) A highway was built right through the heart of the community. Lisa, I was talking about our west side\u2014what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered. The community\u2014cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity. Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding. (Applause.) We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change. That\u2019s what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today. (Applause.) Because today, we\u2019re announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community. The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing. That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family. (Applause.) And I might add\u2014and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can\u2019t figure this one out, Congressman Horsford. But if you live in a Black community and there\u2019s another one on the other side of the highway\u2014it\u2019s a white community; it\u2019s the\u2014built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community, you\u2019re\u2014can pay more for your auto insurance.\u00a0 Shockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago. Lower today. That\u2019s wrong. And we\u2019re committing to changing that. Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that\u2014into that home and provide for their families. Second, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities. As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in federal buildings, to professional services. We have a thing called\u2014I won\u2019t go into it all because there\u2019s not enough time now. But I\u2019m determined to use every taxpayer\u2019s dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri\u2013 to build American products. And as part of that, I\u2019m going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and brown small businesses. Right now, it calls for 10 percent; I\u2019m going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent (inaudible). (Applause.) I have the authority to do that.\u00a0 Just imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities. That\u2014the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as white entrepreneurs are. But they don\u2019t have lawyers. They don\u2019t have\u2014they\u2014they don\u2019t have accountants, but they have great ideas.\u00a0 Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make? And I promise you, that\u2019s why I set up the\u2014a national Small Business Administration that\u2019s much broader. Because they\u2019re going to get those loans.\u00a0 Instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, let\u2019s give each and every child, three and four years old, access to school\u2014not daycare, school. (Applause.) In the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities. It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child\u2014no matter what background they come from; no matter what\u2014if they start school at three years old, they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well, and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives. And let\u2019s unlock more than\u2014an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. (Applause.) I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like\u2014of the future, like cybersecurity. The reason why they don\u2019t\u2014their\u2014their students are equally able to learn as well, and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks. But they don\u2019t have\u2014they don\u2019t have the back\u2014they don\u2019t have the money to provide and build those laboratories. So, guess what? They\u2019re going to get the money to build those laboratories. (Applause.)\u00a0 So, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let\u2019s get about the\u2014about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed Internet, creating space\u2014space to live and work and play safely. Let\u2019s ensure access to healthcare, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores\u2014stock the fresh vegetables and food that\u2014(applause)\u2014in fact, deal with\u2014I mean, these are all things we can do. Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments? The rich will be just as well off. The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better. It\u2019s about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth. It\u2019s about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us. But just as fundamental as any of these investments I\u2019ve discussed\u2014this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote. (Applause.) The right to vote. (Applause.) A lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him. On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him. But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing. He died, I think, about 25 hours later.\u00a0 But you know what John said? He called the right to vote \u201cprecious,\u201d \u201calmost sacred.\u201d He said, \u201cThe most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society\u201d. This sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I\u2019ve never seen\u2014even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer\u2014with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply un-American. It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented. The creed \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody. The obstacle to proc-\u2014to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge. We saw it in the \u201860s, but with the current assault, it\u2019s not just an echo of a distant history.\u00a0 In 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more. We resolved to overcome it all, and we did. More Americans voted in the last election than any\u2014in the midst of a pandemic\u2014than any election in American history. (Applause.)\u00a0 You got voters registered. You got voters to the polls. The rule of law held. Democracy prevailed. We overcame.\u00a0 But today, let me be unequivocal: I\u2019ve been engaged in this work my whole career, and we\u2019re going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again.\u00a0 I will have more to say about this at a later date\u2014the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results.\u00a0 But today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters. (Applause.)\u00a0 And in June\u2014June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill. I hear all the folks on TV saying, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Biden get this done?\u201d Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.\u00a0 But we\u2019re not giving up. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy. The Senate will take it up later this month, and I\u2019m going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage. The House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is\u2014which is critical\u2014(applause)\u2014to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote.\u00a0 To signify the importance of our efforts, today I\u2019m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities.\u00a0 With her leadership and your support, we\u2019re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of work. (Applause.) And finally, we have to\u2014and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still.\u00a0 Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches\u2014the veins bulging on their\u2014as they were screaming. Remember? Just close your eyes and picture what it was. Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th], it broke her heart\u2014a mob of violent white extremists\u2014thugs. Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago. Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. Hate that never goes away. Hate only hides. Jesse, I think I mentioned this to you. I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act\u2014I thought we moved. But what I didn\u2019t realize\u2014I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it.\u00a0 But you know what, Rev? I didn\u2019t realize hate is never defeated; it only hides. It hides. And given a little bit of oxygen\u2014just a little bit oxygen\u2014by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.\u00a0 And so, folks, we can\u2019t\u2014we must not give hate a safe harbor.\u00a0 As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not ISIS, not al Qaeda\u2014white supremacists. (Applause.) That\u2019s not me; that\u2019s the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration.\u00a0 Two weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate. My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty [sic]\u2014of bigotry.\u00a0 But I\u2019m going to close where I started. To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you. Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your commitment. And thank your children, and your grandchildren, and your unc-\u2014and your nieces and your nephews.\u00a0 To see and learn from you is a gift\u2014a genuine gift. Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America\u2019s greatest historians\u2014Tulsa\u2019s proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor\u2014said, and I quote, \u201cWhatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love. How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?\u201d On this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit\u2014the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation. I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today. I mean that. And the reason is because of this new generation of young people. They\u2019re the best educated, they\u2019re the least prejudiced, the most open generation in American history.\u00a0 And although I have no scientific basis of what I\u2019m about to say, but those of you who are over 50\u2014how often did you ever see\u2014how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples? Not a joke.\u00a0 I challenge you\u2014find today, when you turn on the stations\u2014sit on one station for two hours. And I don\u2019t know how many commercials you\u2019ll see\u2014eight to five\u2014two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them. That\u2019s not by accident. They\u2019re selling soap, man. (Laughter.) Not a joke.\u00a0 Remember ol\u2019 Pat Caddell? He used to say, \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s happening in American culture? Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.\u201d\u00a0 We have hope in folks like you, honey. I really mean it. We have hope. But we\u2019ve got to give them support. We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done. Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn\u2019t care deeply about this. You sure in the devil didn\u2019t come to hear me speak. (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I really mean it. I really mean it. Let\u2019s not give up, man. Let\u2019s not give up.\u00a0 As the old saying goes, \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about famous people, but I\u2019m\u2014my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They think I did it because I\u2019m Irish. They think I did it because we Irish\u2014we have a little chip on our shoulder. A little bit, sometimes.\u00a0 That\u2019s not why I did it; I did it because they\u2019re the best poets in the world. (Laughter.) You can smile, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s true.\u00a0 There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called \u201cThe Cure at Troy\u201d\u2014Seamus Heaney. And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people.\u00a0 It said, \u201cHistory teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.\u201d\u00a0 Let\u2019s make it rhyme. Thank you. ",

        "intro": "In honor of the first 100 days of his administration, President Joe Biden addresses a joint session of Congress. He covers a wide range of topics including the success of his American Rescue Plan and the proposed American Jobs Plan focused on infrastructure\u00a0and the American Families Plan focused on\u00a0education and childcare.\u00a0He explains that\u00a0his proposals will be paid for by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. He also touches on shoring up the Affordable Care Act, lowering prescription drug prices, fighting\u00a0climate change, and enacting gun control legislation.\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. And Mitch and Chuck will understand it\u2019s good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all. Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President\u2014(applause)\u2014no President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it\u2019s about time. (Applause.) First Lady\u2014(applause)\u2014I\u2019m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different\u2014a reminder of the extraordinary times we\u2019re in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America. I stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration\u2014100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation\u2014we all did\u2014that was in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again\u2014(applause)\u2014turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength. We all know life can knock us down. But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness. After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We\u2019re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world that there\u2019s no quit in America\u2014none. One hundred days ago, America\u2019s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor-\u2014Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people\u2014Democrats, independents, and Republicans\u2014we did act. Together we passed the American Rescue Plan\u2014one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We\u2019re already seeing the results. (Applause.) We\u2019re already seeing the results.\u00a0 After I promised we\u2019d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people\u2019s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. (Applause.) Thanks to all the help of all of you, we\u2019re marshalling\u2014with your help, everyone\u2019s help\u2014we\u2019re marshalling every federal resource. We\u2019ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We\u2019re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities. Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16\u2014everyone is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. (Applause.) Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They\u2019re available. You\u2019re eligible now. When I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected\u2014fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January\u2014down 80 percent because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse\u2014I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d She looked at me and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s like every shot is giving a dose of hope\u201d\u2014was the phrase. \u201cA dose of hope.\u201d A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease\u2014wrote to me, said she\u2019s worried\u2014that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a\u2014at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated, and just cried\u2014cried out of joy and cried out of relief. Parents see the smiles on their kids\u2019 faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything. Those things mean everything. You know, there\u2019s still\u2014you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans\u2014there\u2019s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can\u2019t let our guard down. But tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements\u2014logistical achievements this country has ever seen. What else have we done in those first 100 days? We kept our commitment\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We\u2019ve already sent more than one\u2014160 million checks out the door. It\u2019s making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it\u2019s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn\u2019t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment. A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor\u2014something she said she put off for months because she didn\u2019t have the money.\u00a0 One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up\u2014cars lined up for miles. And not\u2014not people who just barely ever start those cars\u2014nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I don\u2019t know about you, but I didn\u2019t ever think I\u2019d see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own these people are in this position. That\u2019s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.\u00a0 We\u2019re also providing rental assistance\u2014you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand\u2014keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that\u2014800,000 in that period. We\u2019re making one of the largest one-time ever investments\u2014ever\u2014in improving healthcare for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. (Applause.) And in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days\u2014more jobs in the first\u2014(applause)\u2014more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record. The International Monetary Fund\u2014(applause)\u2014the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving\u2014moving forward\u2014but we can\u2019t stop now. We\u2019re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We\u2019re at a great inflection point in history. We have to do more than just build back better\u2014I mean \u201cbuild back.\u201d We have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have. Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America\u2014our attitudes, as well as our opportunities. The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America. Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon\u2014now we\u2019re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That\u2019s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan\u2014a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.\u00a0 It\u2019s clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water\u2014a clear and present danger to our children\u2019s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation\u2019s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. (Applause.) And in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn\u2019t have it. This is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would \u2014 THE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course. THE PRESIDENT:\u2014because I know it will get done. (Applause.) It creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures\u2014with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that. (Applause.) Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers. Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic\u2014two million. And too often because they couldn\u2019t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help. Eight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it\u2019s not important, check out in your own district. Democrat or Republican\u2014Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern\u2014almost as much as their children\u2014is taking care of an elderly loved one who can\u2019t be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth. For too long, we\u2019ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: \u201cjobs.\u201d Jobs. Jobs. (Applause.)\u00a0 For me, when I think \u201cclimate change,\u201d I think \u201cjobs.\u201d The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers\u2014IBEW members\u2014installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own\u2014(applause)\u2014so we can own the electric car market. (Applause.) Farmers\u2014farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. (Applause.) Look, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can\u2019t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. (Applause.) So, folks, there\u2019s no reason why American\u2014American workers can\u2019t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have this capacity. (Applause.) We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world. The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs\u2014jobs Americans can raise a family on\u2014as my dad would then say, \u201cwith a little breathing room.\u201d And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American. And I might note, parenthetically\u2014(applause)\u2014that does not\u2014that does not violate any trade agreement. It\u2019s been the law since the \u201930s: Buy American.\u00a0 American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. (Applause.) And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited. It will be American products. Now I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of you\u2014so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that\u2019s so rapidly changing. It\u2019s frightening.\u00a0 I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it, that\u2019s what people are most worried about: \u201cCan I fit in?\u201d Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is a\u2014it is an eight-year program. These are good-paying jobs that can\u2019t be outsourced. Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don\u2019t require an associate\u2019s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. That\u2019s what it is. (Applause.) And it recognizes something I\u2019ve always said in this chamber and the other. Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn\u2019t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. (Applause.) So that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act\u2014the PRO Act\u2014and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize. (Applause.) And, by the way, while you\u2019re thinking about sending things to my desk\u2014(laughs)\u2014let\u2019s raise the minimum wage to $15. (Applause.) No one\u2014no one working 40 hours a week\u2014no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line. We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we\u2019re doing this, let\u2019s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well\u2014equal pay. It\u2019s been much too long. And if you\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s too long, look behind me. (Applause.) And finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record. We will see more technological change\u2014and some of you know more about this than I do\u2014we\u2019ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That\u2019s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing. And we\u2019re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world. Decades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America\u20142 percent of our gross domestic product\u2014in research and development.\u00a0 Today, Mr. Secretary, that\u2019s less than 1 percent. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy. The Secretary of Defense can tell you\u2014and those of you on\u2014who work on national security issues know\u2014the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA\u2014the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here\u2014and that\u2019s been a long time ago\u2014to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -\u2013 that\u2019s their only job. And it\u2019s a semi-separate agency; it\u2019s under the Defense Department. It\u2019s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security. The National Institute of Health\u2014the NIH \u2013- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. (Applause.) And that would\u2014here\u2019s what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and cancer. I\u2019ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President\u2014almost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I\u2019ll never forget you standing and mentioning\u2014saying you\u2019d name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot. But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So, let\u2019s end cancer as we know it. (Applause.) It\u2019s within our power. (Applause.) It\u2019s within our power to do it. (Applause.) Investments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we\u2019re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal. So, let\u2019s get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I\u2019d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different\u2014they think are better. I welcome those ideas.\u00a0 But the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. (Applause.) Look, we can\u2019t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century. Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi\u2014traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion. He\u2019s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others\u2014autocrats\u2014think that democracy can\u2019t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.\u00a0 To win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America. First is access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world. It\u2019s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st\u2014in the 20th century.\u00a0 But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,\u201d I wonder whether we\u2019d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century. That\u2019s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can. The great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation. The research shows when a young child goes to school\u2014not daycare\u2014they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school. When you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. (Applause.) We can do that. (Applause.)\u00a0 And we\u2019ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don\u2019t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy\u2014all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future. Jill was a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said\u2014(applause). She has long\u2014(applause). If I\u2019ve heard it once, I\u2019ve heard it a thousand times: \u201cJoe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.\u201d She\u2019ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill. Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee\u2014(applause). And I\u2019m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won\u2019t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave\u2014family and medical leave. We\u2019re one of the few industrial countries in the world\u2014(applause).\u00a0 No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones \u2013- a parent, a spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 per child if they\u2019re\u00a0under\u00a0[over] six years of age\u2014I mean, excuse me\u2014under\u2014over six years of age, and $3,600 for children\u00a0over\u00a0[under] six years of age. With two parents, two kids, that\u2019s $7,200 in the pockets that\u2019s going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half. (Applause.) And we can afford it.\u00a0 So we did that in the rec-\u2014in the\u2014in the last piece of legislation we passed.\u00a0But let\u2019s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. (Applause.) The American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that\u2019s really popular on this side of the aisle. (Laughter.) But let\u2019s make that provision permanent so their premiums don\u2019t go back up. (Applause.) In addition to my Families Plan, I\u2019m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families.\u00a0 The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women\u2019s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly\u2014how badly it\u2019s needed. Let\u2019s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care\u2014in the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) And let\u2019s lower prescription drug costs. (Applause.)\u00a0 We know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.\u00a0 In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America\u2014nearly three times\u2014for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do what we\u2019ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this\u2014in this body\u2014in Congress. Let\u2019s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. (Applause.) And, by the way, that won\u2019t just\u2014that won\u2019t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\u00a0 And the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It\u2019s within our power to do it; let\u2019s do it now. (Applause.) We\u2019ve talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let\u2019s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America. (Applause.)\u00a0 So, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let\u2019s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It\u2019s\u2014but it\u2019s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Just their fair share.\u00a0 Sometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation\u2019s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It\u2019s not right.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans\u2014those making over $400,000 or more\u2014back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That\u2019s where it was when George W. was President.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck.\u00a0 We\u2019re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action. Three tenths of 1 percent.\u00a0 And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It\u2019s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.\u00a0 I\u2019m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden\u2014an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They\u2019re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair\u2014(applause)\u2014fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country. When you hear someone say that they don\u2019t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: \u201cWhose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?\u201d\u00a0 Look, the big tax cut of 2017\u2014remember, it was supposed to pay for itself\u2014that was how it was sold\u2014and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\u00a0 According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the\u2014below a hundred.\u00a0 The pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic\u2014working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion\u2014in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they\u2019re now worth more than $4 trillion.\u00a0 My fellow Americans, trickle-down\u2014trickle-down economics has never worked and it\u2019s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out.\u00a0(Applause.)\u00a0 You know, there\u2019s a broad consensus of economists\u2014left, right, center\u2014and they agree what I\u2019m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation.\u00a0 I\u2019ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power. In my conversations with world leaders\u2014and I\u2019ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now\u2014I\u2019ve made it known\u2014I\u2019ve made it known that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, \u201cWe see America is back but for how long? But for how long?\u201d My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we\u2019re back, but that we\u2019re back to stay and that we aren\u2019t going to go it alone. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to do it by leading with our allies. (Applause.) \u00a0 No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time\u2014from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi-\u2014what we\u2019re experiencing now with pandemics.\u00a0 There\u2019s no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply\u2014as it grows to meet our needs; and we\u2019re meeting them\u2014will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world\u2014(applause)\u2014and in consequence, influenced the world. (Applause.) But every American will have access before that occur-\u2014every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19\u2014from the vaccines we have. Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it\u2019s a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That\u2019s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord\u2014because if we do everything perfectly, it\u2019s not going to ultimately matter. I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world\u2014China, Russia, India, the European Union\u2014and I said I\u2019d do it in my first 100 days. I want to be very blunt about it: I had\u2014my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus\u2014the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world. If you\u2019ve watched any of it\u2014and you were all busy; I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t have much time\u2014that\u2019s what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren\u2019t doing their fair share. The investments I\u2019ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussions\u2014in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \u201cWe welcome the competition. We\u2019re not looking for conflict.\u201d But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America\u2019s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state\u2014to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we\u2019ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe\u2014not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. (Applause.)\u00a0 I told him what I\u2019ve said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments\u2014our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances. And I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President\u2014President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea\u2014the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal. It\u2019s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we\u2019re dealing with the American idea. With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we\u2019re not going to seek esca-\u2014ecala-\u2014exc-\u2014excuse me\u2014escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true. And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia\u2019s interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have. But we can also cooperate when it\u2019s in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we\u2019re working to do it on climate change. But he understands we will respond. On Iran and North Korea\u2014nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world\u2014we\u2019re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di-\u2014through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. (Applause.) We have\u2014(applause)\u2014we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I\u2019m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone.\u00a0 Today we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. The War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists\u2014the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11\u2014and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it. If you\u2019ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you\u2019ve kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of value\u2014valor and sacrifice, it\u2019s time to bring those troops home. (Applause.)\u00a0 Look, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has\u2014terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.\u00a0 And we won\u2019t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We\u2019re not going to ignore that either. My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago, before her father\u2019s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd\u2019s young daughter. She\u2019s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said, \u201cMy daddy changed the world.\u201d Well, after the conviction of George Floyd\u2019s murderer, we can see how right she was if\u2014if we have the courage to act as a Congress.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want\u2014(applause)\u2014I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd\u2019s name that passed the House already.\u00a0 I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let\u2019s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s death. (Applause.)\u00a0 The country supports this reform, and Congress should act\u2014should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice\u2014real justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity\u2014good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans\u2014Black, white, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans. Look, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. (Applause.) You acted decisively. (Applause.) And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we\u2019ve seen over the past year\u2014this past year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. (Applause.) To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back. Another thing: Let\u2019s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. (Applause.) Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it. It\u2019ll close the\u2014the act that has to be authorized now will close the \u201cboyfriend\u201d loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said, \u201cThis is an abuser. You can\u2019t own a gun.\u201d It\u2019s to close that loophole that existed.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America\u201450 a month. Let\u2019s pass it and save some lives. (Applause.) And I need not\u2014I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America\u2014250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the \u201990s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report in over 10 years. But in the early twe-\u20142000s, the law expired, and we\u2019ve seen daily bloodshed since. I\u2019m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn\u2019t see bloodshed. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know\u2014the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence\u2014I laid out several of the Department of Justice a-\u2014actions that are being taken to\u2014impact on this epidemic.\u00a0 One of them is banning so-called \u201cghost guns.\u201d These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes and they can\u2019t be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren\u2019t required to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon that\u2019s lethal. But no more. And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it\u2019s time for Congress to act as well. (Applause.) Look, I don\u2019t want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done. We did it before, and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think\u2014deer are wearing Kevlar vests? (Laughter.) They\u2019ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn\u2019t be able to buy a gun. These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners. The country supports reform and is\u2014and Congress should act. This shouldn\u2019t be a red or blue issue. And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can\u2019t yell \u201cFire!\u201d in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever.\u00a0 We\u2019re not changing the Constitution; we\u2019re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; I think it\u2019s an American issue. And here\u2019s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let\u2019s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we\u2019ve done nothing about it. It\u2019s time to fix it. On day one of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks\u2014the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually\u2014if you actually want to solve a problem, I\u2019ve sent a bill to take a close look at it.\u00a0 We have to\u2014also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to\u2014to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters. When I was President, my President\u2014when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it. I\u2019m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she\u2019ll get the job done. (Applause.) Now, look, if you don\u2019t like my plan, let\u2019s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMers\u2014the young people who have only known America as their home. (Applause.)\u00a0 And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster. (Applause.) As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. (Applause.)\u00a0 Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let\u2019s argue over it, let\u2019s debate it, but let\u2019s act. (Applause.) And if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Most people\u2014(applause). More people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated. Instead, it\u2019s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away. (Applause.) The country supports it. The Congress should act now. (Applause.) Look, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds. Lives were put at risk\u2014many of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis \u2013- a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic\u2014still vital today.\u00a0 Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver the most\u2014to the most pressing needs of our people?\u00a0 Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart? America\u2019s adversaries \u2013- the autocrats of the world \u2013- are betting we can\u2019t. And I promise you, they\u2019re betting we can\u2019t. They believe we\u2019re too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works\u2014that our government still works and we can deliver for our people. In our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people\u2019s faith in democracy to deliver. We\u2019re vaccinating the nation. We\u2019re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We\u2019re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives. Opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice\u2014that\u2019s the essence of America. That\u2019s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words\u2014as trite as it sounds\u2014\u201cWe the People\u201d. Well, it\u2019s time to remember that \u201cWe the People\u201d are the government\u2014you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It\u2019s us. It\u2019s \u201cWe the People.\u201d In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \u201cIn America, we do our part.\u201d We all do our part. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking: that we do our part, all of us. If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to America. As I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America\u2014not because I\u2019m President, because what\u2019s happening with the American people. We have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \u201cWe the People\u201d did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together. We united. With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America. Folks, as I told every world leader I\u2019ve ever met with over the years, it\u2019s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn\u2019t. (Applause.) We are the United States of America. (Applause.) There is not a single thing\u2014nothing\u2014nothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. (Applause.) So let\u2019s begin to get together. (Applause.) God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. (Applause.) ",

        "intro": "At the Carpenters Training Center in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, President Biden announces the details of the American Jobs Plan. The plan proposes to modernize\u00a0existing transportation infrastructure, such as\u00a0roads, bridges, and airports, and build new rail corridors and transit lines. It will also work to tackle climate change by cutting pollution and providing incentives for Americans to buy clean cars. The plan will also focus on replacing the nation's lead pipes and providing high-speed internet service. President Biden plans to pay for the plan by increasing the corporate tax rate, and he makes a plea for bipartisan support for the plan.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) (Inaudible) Mike asked me \u2014 and I said to Bobby, my good friend \u2014 he asked me back there \u2014 he said, \u201cDo you ever get nervous?\u201d And I \u2014 he said, \u201cBecause I got up this morning, made breakfast for my kids. I\u2019ve got to introduce the President.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 And what I say to you, Mike: You did a heck of a job. But I\u2019d get nervous if I had to get up in the middle of the night, climb up a telephone pole, replace \u2014 in the middle of a storm \u2014 a connection that knocked out everybody\u2019s electricity, and put a transformer in. That\u2019s what would make me nervous. So what you did was really good. I couldn\u2019t do what you do, pal. I couldn\u2019t do what you do. \u00a0 And I want to \u2014 and it\u2019s true, Mike. You\u2019re a union guy; me too. I got in trouble, but I don\u2019t make any apologies for it. I\u2019m a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class. It\u2019s about time they start to get a piece of the action. \u00a0 To all my colleagues \u2014 (applause) \u2014 to the County Executives, to the Mayor, to everyone who\u2019s here, I want to say: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman, for the passport into your district. And I appreciate being here. I\u2019m honored to be with you. \u00a0 Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America. And today, I return as your President to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that \u2014 rebuild the backbone of America. \u00a0 It\u2019s a vision not seen through the eyes of Wall Street or Washington, but through the eyes of hardworking people, like the people I grew up with; people like Mike and his union family; union workers in this Carpenters Training Center; people like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware.\u00a0 \u00a0 People who get up every day, work hard, raise their family, pay their taxes, serve their country, and volunteer for their communities, and just looking for a little bit of breathing room \u2014 just a little bit of light.\u00a0 \u00a0 Ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. The people who break their necks every day for their families and the country they love \u2014 a country that, in fact \u2014 which, on the day I was elected, was in extreme distress with a virus on a deadly rampage that has now killed four thou- \u2014 excuse me, five hundred \u2014 I carry it in my pocket every day. I have the list of exactly how many have died: 547,296 Americans dead from the virus \u2014 more than all the people killed in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, 9/11. 547,296 Americans. And an economy that left millions out of work and created so much anxiety.\u00a0 \u00a0 That\u2019s why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan with the help of my friends here in the Congress. I really mean that. It didn\u2019t pass by a whole lot, but with the leadership of Conor and Bobby and Mayor \u2014 just \u2014 you got it done, because it was an emergency. We needed to act to save jobs, to save businesses, and to save lives. And that\u2019s what we did.\u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019re beginning to see the results. We\u2019re on our way to having given 200 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of my presidency. When I said I\u2019d get 100 million done, people thought it was a significant exaggeration. We\u2019re going to get 200 million done \u2014 twice the original goal \u2014 because of all the help of all of you. \u00a0 Leading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6 percent this year. That\u2019s a rate we haven\u2019t seen in years and years. We can cut child poverty in half this year. With the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019re meeting immediate emergencies. Now it\u2019s time to rebuild. \u00a0 Even before the crisis we\u2019re now facing, those at the very top in America were doing very well, which is fine. They were doing great. But everyone else was falling behind. The pandemic only made the division so much worse and more obvious. Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saw their net worth increase by $4 trillion. It just goes to show you how distorted and unfair our economy has become. It wasn\u2019t always this way. \u00a0 Well, it\u2019s time to change that. I\u2019d note, parenthetically, that I got criticized for giving tax breaks to middle-class and poor folks this last time. I didn\u2019t hear that cry \u2014 hue and cry when we were doing the same thing when Trump\u2019s tax bill passed and 83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent. \u00a0 You know, this is not to target those who\u2019ve made it; not to seek retribution. This is about opening opportunities for everybody else. And here\u2019s the truth: We all will do better when we all do well. It\u2019s time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out, not the top down. It hadn\u2019t worked very well. For the economy overall, it hadn\u2019t worked \u2014 because Wall Street didn\u2019t build this country; you, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class. (Applause.)\u00a0 \u00a0 And it\u2019s time \u2014 in this time, we\u2019ll rebuild the middle class. We\u2019re going to bring everybody along. Regardless of your background, your color, your religion, (inaudible) everybody gets to come along. \u00a0 So, today, I\u2019m proposing a plan for the nation that rewards work, not just rewards wealth. It builds a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed, and it\u2019s going to create the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world. It\u2019s not a plan that tinkers around the edges. It\u2019s a once-in-a generation investment in America, unlike anything we\u2019ve seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and the Space Race decades ago. \u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s the largest American jobs investment since World War Two. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs. It will grow the economy, make us more competitive around the world, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years.\u00a0 \u00a0 Is it big? Yes. Is it bold? Yes. And we can get it done. \u00a0 It has two parts: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. Both are essential to our economic future. In a few weeks, I\u2019ll talk about the Americans Family Plan, but today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan. \u00a0 I\u2019ll begin with the heart of the plan: It modernizes transportation infrastructure \u2014 our roads, our bridges, our airports. I just left your airport. The director of the airport said, \u201cWe\u2019re about to renovate the airport.\u201d Is that right, Mr. County Executive? \u201cWe\u2019re going to renovate. We\u2019re going to employ thousands of people.\u201d And she looked at me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this plan.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 It grows the economy in key ways. It puts people to work to repair and upgrade so \u2014 that we badly need. It makes it easier and more efficient to move goods, to get to work, and to make us more competitive around the world. \u00a0 Some of your local officials know, when someone wants to come into the area and a company wants to invest, what do they ask? \u201cWhere\u2019s the first rail bed? How can I get to the railroad? What access to interstate do I have? What\u2019s the water like? Tell me about it.\u201d And it goes on and on. \u00a0 It\u2019s about infrastructure. The American Jobs Plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets that are in difficult, difficult shape right now. It\u2019ll fix the nation\u2019s 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement. Remember that bridge that went down? We got 10 of the most economically significant bridges with more commerce going across it that need to be replaced. \u00a0 We\u2019ll also repair 10,000 bridges, desperately needed upgrades to unclog traffic, keep people safe, and connect our cities, towns, and Tribes across the country. \u00a0 The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days. It\u2019ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports. \u00a0 The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. It\u2019ll protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seizing incredible opportunities for American workers and American farmers in a clean energy future.\u00a0 \u00a0 Skilled workers, like one we just heard from, building a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations, creating good-paying jobs by leading the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric cars and trucks.\u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019re going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale reberts [sic] \u2014 rebates to help all American families afford clean vehicles of the future. The federal government owns an enormous fleet of vehicles which are going to be transitioned to clean electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles right here in the United States, by American workers with American products. \u00a0 When we make all these investments, we\u2019re going to make sure, as the executive order I signed early on, that we buy American. That means investing in American-based companies and American workers. Not a contract will go out, that I control, that will not go to a company that is an American company with American products, all the way down the line, and American workers.\u00a0 \u00a0 And we\u2019ll buy the goods we need from all of America, communities that have historically been left out of these investments: Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, rural, small businesses, entrepreneurs across the country. \u00a0 Look, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes \u2014 where they get their water from \u2014 pipes that are lead-based pipes, including pipes for drinking water. \u00a0 According to scientists, there is simply no safe exposure to lead for a child. Lead can slow development, cause learning behaviors and hearing problems. \u00a0 The American Jobs Plan will put plumbers and pipefitters to work, replacing 100 percent of the nation\u2019s lead pipes and service lines so every American, every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water. \u00a0 With each $5,000 investment replacing a line, that can mean up to $22,000 in healthcare costs saved \u2014 a chance to protect our children, help them learn and thrive.\u00a0 \u00a0 We can\u2019t delay. We can\u2019t delay another minute. It\u2019s long past due. \u00a0 You know, in America, where the early interest was in Internet \u2014 this thing called the Internet that we invested \u2014 we invented, the early \u2014 the early Internet was invented here. Millions of Americans, though, lack access to reliable high-speed Internet, including more than 35 percent of rural America. \u00a0 It\u2019s a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic. American Jobs will make sure every single \u2014 every single American has access to high quality, affordable, high-speed Internet for businesses, for schools. \u00a0 And when I say \u201caffordable,\u201d I mean it. Americans pay too much for Internet service. We\u2019re going to drive down the price for families who have service now, and make it easier for families who don\u2019t have affordable service to be able to get it now. \u00a0 As you saw in Texas and elsewhere, our electric and power\u00a0\u2014 power grids are vulnerable to storms, catastrophic failures, and security lapses, with tragic results. \u00a0 My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work \u2014 hundred of thousands of people to work \u2014 line workers, electricians, and laborers \u2014 laying thousands of miles of transmission line; building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid; and capping hundreds of thousands of, literally, orphan oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up because they\u2019re abandoned \u2014 paying the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dug that well in the first place. \u00a0 We\u2019ll build, upgrade, and weatherize affordable, energy-efficient housing and commercial buildings for millions of Americans. \u00a0 Even before the pandemic, millions of working families faced enormous \u2014 enormous financial and personal strain trying to raise their kids and care for their parents at the same time \u2014 the so-called \u201csandwich generation\u201d \u2014 or family members with disability. You got a child at home, you can\u2019t stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose \u2014 you\u2019re going to put the child at risk or you lose your job; or you have an elderly parent you\u2019re taking care of. And seniors and people with disabilities living independently feel that strain as well. But we know, if they can remain independently living, they live longer. \u00a0 The American Jobs Plan is going to help in big ways. It\u2019s going to extend access to quality, affordable home or community-based care. Think of expanded vital services like programs for seniors, or think of homecare workers going into homes of seniors and people with disabilities, cooking meals, helping them get around their homes, and helping them be able to live more independently. \u00a0 For too long, caregivers \u2014 who are disproportionately women, and women of color, and immigrants \u2014 have been unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. \u00a0 This plan, along with the American Families Plan, changes that with better wages, benefits, and opportunities for millions of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that works for them. \u00a0 You know, decades ago, the United States government used to spend 2 percent of its GDP \u2014 its gross domestic product \u2014 on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1 percent. I think it\u2019s seven-tenths of 1 percent.\u00a0 \u00a0 Here\u2019s why that matters: We\u2019re one of only a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of GDP has declined constantly over the last 25 years.\u00a0And we\u2019ve fallen back. The rest of the world is closing in and closing in fast.\u00a0 We can\u2019t allow this to continue. The American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal non-defense research and development spending on record. It\u2019s going to boost America\u2019s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs \u2014 markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, the competition with China in particular.\u00a0 Critics say we shouldn\u2019t spend this money. They ask, \u201cWhat do we get out of it?\u201d Well, they said the same thing when we first flew into space for the first time. They said the same thing.\u00a0 Well, pushing the frontiers led to big benefits back home. When NASA created Apollo\u2019s digital flight control system \u2014 unheard of at the time \u2014 it led to technologies that help us today to drive our cars and fly our planes.\u00a0 When NASA invented ways to keep food safe for the astronauts, it led to programs that have been used to \u2014 for decades to keep food safe in supermarkets. At least 2,000 products and services have been developed and commercialized as a result of American space exploration.\u00a0 GPS has helped us find each other. Computer chips allow us to see and talk to one another, even when we\u2019re separated by mountains and oceans \u2014 singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and watching the first steps of that new baby grandchild; comforting each other when comfort is needed.\u00a0 Think about what it means to you and your loved ones. We just have to imagine again.\u00a0 I had a long discussion with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, when he called to congratulate me. We spent two hours on the phone. And he said \u2014 and was astonished by NASA\u2019s security team and the China experts who were on the line \u2014 he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve always said, Mr.\u00a0President, that you can define America in one word: possibilities.\u201d That\u2019s who we are.\u00a0 In America, anything is possible. Like what we did with vaccines a decade ago that laid the foundation for COVID-19 vaccines we have today. Like we did when the Interstate Highway System that transformed the way we traveled, lived, worked, and developed. Americans could visit relatives anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon. Businesses here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix. To this day, about a quarter of all the miles Americans drive each year on one of those very original highways.\u00a0 Imagine what we can do, what\u2019s within our reach, when we modernize those highways. You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train.\u00a0We can connect high-speed, affordable, reliable Internet wherever you live.\u00a0 Imagine knowing that you\u2019re handing your children and grandchildren a country that will lead the world in producing clean energy technology and will need to address one of the biggest threats of our time. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u00a0 Altogether, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs \u2014 estimated by some Wall Street outfits: over 18 million jobs over four years; good-paying jobs.\u00a0 It also works to level the playing field, empower workers, and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs that you can raise a family on, and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively.\u00a0 That\u2019s why my plan asked Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act \u2014 the PRO Act \u2014 and send it to my desk.\u00a0 This plan is important, not only for what and how it builds, but it\u2019s also important to where we build. It includes everyone, regardless of your race or your ZIP Code.\u00a0 Too often, economic growth and recovery is concentrated on the coast. Too often, investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind.\u00a0 There is talent, innovation everywhere. And this plan connects that talent through cities, small towns, rural communities; through our businesses and our universities; through our entrepreneurs, union workers all across America.\u00a0 We have to move now. Because I\u2019m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future.\u00a0 What I\u2019m proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America\u2019s future, spread largely over eight years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally, create more revenue as well. They are among the highest-value investments we can make in the nation \u2014 investing in our infrastructure. But put it another way, failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. That\u2019s what crumbling infrastructure does. And our infrastructure is crumbling. We\u2019re ranked 13th in the world.\u00a0 What\u2019s more, it heightens our vulnerability to \u2014 it attac- \u2014 attracts our adversaries to compete in ways that they haven\u2019t up to now. And our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure.\u00a0 Put simply, these are investments we have to make. We can afford to make them \u2014 or, put another way, we can\u2019t afford not to.\u00a0 So how do we pay for it? I spoke to the Majority Leader and \u2014 no longer \u2014 I guess he\u2019s no longer the Majority Leader; he has been for a long time. I spoke for the Republican \u2014 I spoke to the Republican Leader about the plan. Everybody is for doing something on infrastructure. Why haven\u2019t we done it? Well, no one wants to pay for it.\u00a0 Less than four years ago, as I said, the Congress passed a tax cut of $2 trillion, increasing the national debt $2 trillion. It didn\u2019t meet virtually any of the predictions it would in terms of growing the economy. Overwhelmingly, the benefits of that tax package went to the wealthiest Americans. It even included new investments that would profit by shifting profits and jobs overseas if you\u2019re a corporation. It was bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, and wrong for our future. So, here\u2019s what I\u2019d do. I start with one rule: No one \u2014 let me say it again \u2014 no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up. Period. This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American \u2014 in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well.\u00a0 But here\u2019s the deal: Right now, a middle-class couple \u2014 a firefighter and a teacher with two kids \u2014 making a combined salary of, say, $110-, $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad \u2014 brings it home and then sell it \u2014 they pay nothing at all. We\u2019re going to raise the corporate tax. It was 35 percent, which is too high. We all agreed, five years ago, it should go down to 28 percent, but they reduced it to 21 percent. We\u2019re going to raise it back to \u2014 up to 28 percent.\u00a0 No one should be able to complain about that. It\u2019s still lower than what that rate was between World War Two and 2017. Just doing that one thing will generate $1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 years. In 2019, an independent analysis found that are 91 \u2014 let me say it again, 91 Fortune 500 companies \u2014 the biggest companies in the world, including Amazon \u2014 they used various loopholes so they\u2019d pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax. I don\u2019t want to punish them, but that\u2019s just wrong. That\u2019s just wrong. A fireman and a teacher paying 22 percent? Amazon and 90 other major corporations are paying zero in federal taxes? I\u2019m going to put an end to that, and here\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it. We\u2019re establishing a global minimum tax for U.S. corporations of 21 percent. We\u2019re going to level the international playing field. That alone will raise $1 trillion over 15 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also eliminate deductions by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. You do that, you pay a penalty; you don\u2019t get a reward in my plan. And use the savings from that to give companies tax credits to locate manufacturing here \u2014 in manufacturing and production here in the United States.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporations who either fail to report their incomes or under-report. It\u2019s estimated that could raise hundreds of billions of dollars. All of this adds up to more than what I\u2019ve proposed to spend in just 15 years. It\u2019s honest. It\u2019s fiscally responsible. And by the way, as the experts will tell you, it reduces the debt \u2014 the federal debt over the long haul. But let me be clear: These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan. If others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I\u2019m open to other ideas, so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.\u00a0 Let me close with this: Historically, infrastructure had been a bipartisan undertaking, many times led by Republicans. It was Abraham Lincoln who built the transcontinental railroad. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican \u2014 the Interstate Highway System. I could go on. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find a Republican today in the House or Senate \u2014 maybe I\u2019m wrong, gentlemen \u2014 who doesn\u2019t think we have to improve our infrastructure. They know China and other countries are eating our lunch. So there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be bipartisan again.\u00a0 The divisions of the moment shouldn\u2019t stop us from doing the right thing for the future.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office; listen to them, what they have to say; and be open to other ideas. We\u2019ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.\u00a0 I truly believe we\u2019re in a moment where history is going to look back on this time as a fundamental choice that had to be made between democracies and autocracies.\u00a0 You know, there\u2019s a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they\u2019re going to win is democracies can\u2019t reach consensus any longer; autocracies do.\u00a0 That\u2019s what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It\u2019s a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority?\u00a0 I believe we can. I believe we must.\u00a0 Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was all about. And it\u2019s been overwhelmingly popular.\u00a0 When I wrote it, everybody said I had no bipartisan support. We\u2019re overwhelming bipartisan support with Republican \u2014 registered Republican voters. And ask around. If you live in a town with a Republican mayor, a Republican county executive, or a Republican governor, ask them how many would rather get rid of the plan. Ask them if it helped them at all. It\u2019s what the American Jobs Plan is about \u2014 the new one I\u2019m proposing. I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort. I hope and I believe a number of businesses will join this effort. And I hope and believe the American people will join this effort \u2014 Democrats, Republican, and independents.\u00a0 We can do this. We have to do this. We will do this.\u00a0 We just have to remember: This is the United States of America. And I\u2019ve said it a thousand times: There\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity if we act together. So it\u2019s time to move together.\u00a0 Thank you and I hope I get to come back to see you folks after this plan is passed. And the question is: You have to attract even more apprentices, more people, because we\u2019re building so much.\u00a0 God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.) ",

        "intro": "President Joe Biden holds the first press conference of his presidency. He begins with a progress report on the vaccination efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. He also responds to questions from the press about immigration, the Senate filibuster, Afghanistan, and voting rights.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make \u2014 give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people. First, on vaccinations: On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58 \u2014 42 days ahead of schedule. Now, today, I\u2019m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people\u2019s arms. That\u2019s right: 200 million shots in 100 days. I know it\u2019s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close \u2014 not even close \u2014 to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it. And today, we\u2019ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities \u2014 as a consequence of the virus \u2014 by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them. I also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders \u2014 a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we\u2019re really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we\u2019ll meet that goal as well. As of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people\u2019s bank accounts. That\u2019s real money in people\u2019s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon. One final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority \u2014 a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that\u2019s going to take place this year. They\u2019re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent \u2014 a 6 percent growth in GDP. And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That\u2019s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high. So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do. But I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way. Now I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Zeke, the Associated Press. Q\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I\u2019d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m going to \u2014 look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that\u2019s why I put all my focus in the beginning \u2014 there are a lot of problems \u2014 put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems. And the other problems we\u2019re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they\u2019ve been around a long time. And what we\u2019re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and \u2014 whether it\u2019s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country. But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they\u2019re going to lose a family member, whether they\u2019re going to be in a position where they\u2019re not going to be \u2014 they\u2019re going to lose their home because they can\u2019t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to \u2014 to pay their rent. So we\u2019re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that\u2019s the reason why I focused as I have. And here\u2019s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to \u2014 is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I\u2019m not going to do that; I\u2019m just going to move forward and take these things as they come. Q\u00a0 And just to \u2014 to follow up, Mr. President, can your presidency be a success if you can\u2019t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that\u2019s going to be for the American people to decide. I think \u2014 you know, I doubt whether \u2014 maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought \u2014 many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People\u2019s lives are changing. So let\u2019s see what happens. All I know, I\u2019ve been hired to solve problems \u2014 to solve problems, not create division. Okay. How about Yamiche? Q\u00a0 Thanks so much, Mr. President. You\u2019ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn\u2019t come to this country right now; this isn\u2019t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected \u2014 as a moral, decent man \u2014 is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors. How do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won\u2019t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with \u2014 run by CPB [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors? THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I\u2019m the nice guy; that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s happening \u2014 that I\u2019m a decent man or however it\u2019s phrased. That \u2014 you know, that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming, because they know Biden is a good guy. The truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came \u2014 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of \u2014 in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year. In addition to that, there is a \u2014 and nobody \u2014 and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That\u2019s not the reason they\u2019re coming. The reason they\u2019re coming is that it\u2019s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they\u2019re coming because of the circumstances in-country \u2014 in-country. The way to deal with this problem \u2014 and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator \u2014 I mean, Vice President \u2014 putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving. What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn\u2019t use it. He didn\u2019t do it. And in addition to that, what he did \u2014 he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and \u2014 and has been \u2014 continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the \u2014 the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those \u2014 those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days \u2014 a little while. But he dismantled all of that. And so what we\u2019re doing now is attempting to rebuild \u2014 rebuild the system that can accommodate the \u2014 what is happening today. And I like to think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a nice guy, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened every year. Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back \u2014 are being sent back. Thousands \u2014 tens of thousands of people who are \u2014 who are over 18 years of age and single \u2014 people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home. We\u2019re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We\u2019re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re not getting across the border. And those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we\u2019re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We\u2019re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers\u2019 arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. Less than \u2014 I think it\u2019s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child \u2014 no one should be in any longer than 72 hours. And today, I went to \u2014 for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and \u2014 and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss \u2014 5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border. So we\u2019re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It\u2019s going to take time. And the other thing we\u2019re doing, I might add \u2014 am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don\u2019t want the details \u2014 Q\u00a0 (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I\u2019ll stop there and fin- \u2014 Q\u00a0 My follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families \u2014 why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. The families that are being allowed to stay, why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there\u2019s \u2014 immigration is a big issue, of course, when it \u2014 related to the filibuster, but there\u2019s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration? Jim Clyburn, someone who \u2014 of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights. THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I\u2019m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate. Let\u2019s go to the first question you asked \u2014 the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not \u2014 some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They\u2019re saying they won\u2019t take them back \u2014 not all of them. We\u2019re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we\u2019re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we\u2019re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children. And what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s an important point to understand \u2014 I know you understand; I don\u2019t mean to say it that way \u2014 an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States \u2014 a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop. What was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we\u2019ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there\u2019s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They\u2019re establishing that right off the bat. If it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says \u2014 to take the extreme case \u2014 \u201cI got a birth certificate.\u201d Then guess what? We\u2019re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately. And so that\u2019s going to reduce significantly \u2014 there\u2019s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we\u2019re occupying now \u2014 both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss \u2014 to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined. Q\u00a0 And can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that \u2014 it used to be required for the filibuster \u2014 and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them \u2014 that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 \u2014 the filibuster existed \u2014 there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it\u2019s being abused in a gigantic way. And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote. So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are \u2014 are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote \u2014 like the basic right to vote. We\u2019ve amended the filibuster in the past. But here\u2019s the deal: As you observed, I\u2019m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50-50 Senate, we\u2019ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her. And so, I\u2019m going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you \u2014 if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to \u2014 anyway \u2014 I \u2014 we\u2019re going to get a lot done. And if we have to \u2014 if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what I\u2019m talking about. Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min \u2014 Ms. Kim. Q\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51? THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You\u2019re going to have to \u2014 the existing rule \u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster. But it\u2019s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re going to do about the filibuster. Let me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega. \u00a0 Q\u00a0 I\u2019d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old, Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Astounding. Q\u00a0 \u2014 and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That\u2019s why she sent him alone from Honduras. So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging \u2014 in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process \u2014 encouraging families like Yossell says to come? THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the idea that I\u2019m going to say \u2014 which I would never do \u2014 \u201cif an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we\u2019re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\u201d \u2014\u00a0no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m not going to do it. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It\u2019s because of earthquakes, floods. It\u2019s because of lack of food. It\u2019s because of gang violence. It\u2019s because of a whole range of things. That \u2014 when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like \u2014 in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn\u2019t walk in the street because they were getting \u2014 their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence. Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, \u201cOkay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I\u2019ll put the lighting in.\u201d We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave. When this hurricane occurred \u2014 two hurricanes \u2014 instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn\u2019t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We\u2019re going to do a lot in our administration. We\u2019re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place. That mother did not sit around with \u2014 on the kitchen table and say, \u201cYou know, I got a great idea: The way I\u2019m going to make sure my son get taken care of is I\u2019m going to put a\u2026\u201d \u2014 how old was he, or she? Q\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s nine. I also met a 10-year-old. THE PRESIDENT: A nine-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and he\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That\u2019s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in \u2014 I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, \u201cYou got to come home and take care of this.\u201d So we put together a plan and it had an impact. And so, the question here is whether \u2014 how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There\u2019s no easy answer Q\u00a0 A quick follow, if I may. \u00a0Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not \u2014 and in this young man\u2019s case, he has a mom at home; there\u2019s an overwhelming reason why he\u2019d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom. Q\u00a0 Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas \u2014 I was there \u2014 is at 1,556 percent capacity \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yep. Q\u00a0 \u2014 right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who say that they \u2014 some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What\u2019s your reaction \u2014 what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what\u2019s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed? THE PRESIDENT: Is \u2014 that\u2019s a serious question, right? Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That\u2019s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely \u2014 not just children, but particularly children \u2014 to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what\u2019s happening. That is totally unacceptable. Ken. Q\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan? THE PRESIDENT: The answer is that it\u2019s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it\u2019s hard to get those troops out. So, what we\u2019ve been doing \u2014 what I\u2019ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing \u2014 has been \u2014 we\u2019ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we\u2019re going to do so in a safe and orderly way. We\u2019re in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies, particularly those who have forces there. And General Austin is \u2014 just met with Ghani and I\u2019m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the \u2014 the \u201cleader,\u201d quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there\u2019s a U.N.-led process that\u2019s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people \u2014 how to end this war. But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it\u2019s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time. Q\u00a0 You just said \u201cif we leave.\u201d Do you think it\u2019s possible that we\u2013 THE PRESIDENT: We will leave. The question is when we leave. Q\u00a0 Do you \u2014 sorry \u2014 do you believe, though, it\u2019s possible we could have troops there next year? THE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I can\u2019t picture that being the case. Okay. Kristen. Q\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward? THE PRESIDENT: I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well. Q\u00a0 How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We\u2019ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven\u2019t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: I will commit to transparency, and \u2014 as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now. And one of the reasons I haven\u2019t gone down \u2014 I have all my \u2014 my chief folks have gone down \u2014 is I don\u2019t want to become the issue. I don\u2019t want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving. Q\u00a0 Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know, to be clear. Q\u00a0 Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that\u2019s happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies? THE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I\u2019m sorry. Q\u00a0 Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor? THE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all \u2014 did not slow up the amount of immigration \u2014 and there\u2019s many people coming. And rolling back the policies of separating children from \u2014 from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and \u2014 I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that. Q\u00a0 If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea? THE PRESIDENT: Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested \u2014 number one. We\u2019re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses \u2014 if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly. But I\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now: consulting with our allies. Q\u00a0 Just a very quick follow-up \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019ve only got another hour now, okay? Q\u00a0 Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Okay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS. Q \u00a0Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters \u2014 the very people who helped to get you elected in November. Are you worried that if you don\u2019t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022? THE PRESIDENT: What I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at five o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances. It\u2019s all designed \u2014 and I\u2019m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in \u2014 outside this White House. I\u2019m not talking about the elected officials; I\u2019m talking about voters. Voters. And so I am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they\u2019re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from \u2014 from becoming the law. Q\u00a0 Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation? THE PRESIDENT: The answer is \u201cyes,\u201d but I\u2019m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now. Q\u00a0 And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven\u2019t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time. THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) My predecessor need do [sic] \u2014 needed to. My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him. Q\u00a0 Have you \u2014 have you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d My plan is to run for reelection. That\u2019s my expectation. Q\u00a0 And then, on \u2014 on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship? THE PRESIDENT: No, I haven\u2019t at all. I\u2019ve been meeting \u2014 when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work \u2014 we\u2019re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we\u2019re working together on a bunch of things. But, look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that \u2014 I would like Republican \u2014 elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I\u2019m doing. And so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is \u2014 the last piece of legislation is so far left \u2014 well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did. Okay. Where am I here? Let me see. Kaitlan. Q\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I\u2019d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that\u2019s on the filibuster. THE PRESIDENT: That counts as a question, but go ahead. Q\u00a0 Okay. I\u2019ll make it quick. It\u2019s a quick question. THE PRESIDENT: No, no \u2014 you can. Q\u00a0 Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis\u2019s funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a \u201crelic\u201d of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q\u00a0 And if not, why not abolish it if it\u2019s a relic of the Jim Crow era? THE PRESIDENT: Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It\u2019s been abused from the time it came into being \u2014 by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let\u2019s deal with the abuse first. Q\u00a0 It sounds like you\u2019re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct? THE PRESIDENT: I answered your question. Q\u00a0 You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection. THE PRESIDENT: I said, \u201cThat is my expectation.\u201d Q\u00a0 So is that a \u201cyes\u201d that you are running for reelection? THE PRESIDENT: Look, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you guys come from, man. I\u2019ve never been able to travel. I\u2019m a great respecter of fate. I\u2019ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain. Q\u00a0 And if you do \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It \u2014 Q\u00a0 If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket? THE PRESIDENT: I would fully expect that to be the case. She\u2019s doing a great job. She\u2019s a great partner. She\u2019s a great partner. Q\u00a0 And do you believe you\u2019ll be running against former President Trump? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. I don\u2019t even think about \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don\u2019t have to answer my question, but, I mean, you know, do you? I mean, look, this is \u2014 the way I view things \u2014 I\u2019ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that\u2019s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hardworking, decent American people who are getting \u2014 really having it stuck to them. I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm. If you notice \u2014 don\u2019t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had \u2014 if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it \u2014 in dealing with the \u2014 the act that we just passed which puts money in people\u2019s pockets \u2014 ordinary people. Did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut \u2014 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they\u2019ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It\u2019s kind of amazing. When the federal budget is saving people\u2019s lives, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans \u2014 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you\u2019re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is \u2014 something is wrong. Their newfound concern. I\u2019m concerned \u2014 look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I\u2019m wrong, and I respect that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country \u2014 the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.\u201d The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I\u2019ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to. So, from my perspective, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 to me, it\u2019s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people \u2014 just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have \u2014 make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether \u2014 since he didn\u2019t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things. And I\u2019m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that \u2014 that same \u2014 that same view, that same sense of what is \u2014 you know, what\u2019s appropriate. Justin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg. Q\u00a0 Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you\u2019ve been in office for a couple months. There\u2019s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there\u2019s the continued human rights abuses. So, today, I\u2019m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems? THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, they\u2019re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about. I\u2019ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China. So, I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter \u2014 my interpreter and his \u2014 going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn\u2019t have a democratic \u2014 with a small \u201cD\u201d \u2014 bone in his body. But he\u2019s a smart, smart guy. He\u2019s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can\u2019t function in an ever \u2014 an ever-complex world. So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were \u2014 his people were on call as well as mine, listening \u2014 we had a two-hour conversation. For two hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I\u2019ve told him in person on several occasions: that we\u2019re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition. Two, that we\u2019ll have strong competition but we\u2019ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we\u2019re going to deal with China effectively, and we\u2019re going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we\u2019re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we\u2019re \u2014 and I\u2019m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the \u201860s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it\u2019s 0.7 percent. I\u2019m going to change that. We\u2019re going to change that. The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I\u2019m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent. One of the reasons why I\u2019ve set up the \u2014 the\u00a0PAB\u00a0[PCAST] \u2014 the President\u2019s board with scientists and the like, again \u2014 is we\u2019re going to invest in medical research \u2014 cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, the things \u2014 industries of the future \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we\u2019re going to make real investments. China is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future. The third \u2014 the second thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to reestablish our alliances. And I\u2019ve been very clear with him, it\u2019s not anti-Chinese. And we\u2019ve talked about it. I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this \u2014 as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we\u2019ve been going close to an hour. I\u2019m happy to go longer. But one of the things that I\u2019m going to be doing, I\u2019m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly \u2014 I think within the next hour or so. I don\u2019t know the exact time. And earlier this month \u2014 and apparently it got the Chinese\u2019s attention; that\u2019s not why I did it \u2014 I met with our allies and how we\u2019re going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States \u2014 the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together. Before too long, I\u2019m going to have \u2014 I\u2019m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we\u2019re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules \u2014 to follow the rules \u2014 whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things. And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands \u2014 he makes no pretense about not understanding what I\u2019m saying any more than I do him \u2014 I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as \u2014 \u201cAnd, Mr. President, as I\u2019ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don\u2019t always live up to our expectations, but it\u2019s a values system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we\u2019re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear \u2014 make it clear what\u2019s happening.\u201d And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President \u2014 at least one did \u2014 but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what\u2019s happening to the Uighurs, what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong, what\u2019s happening in-country. That\u2019s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It\u2019s who we are. So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don\u2019t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That\u2019s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand. Q\u00a0 All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s not where I make the decision; that\u2019s where I make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China. Look around the world. We\u2019re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped \u2014 because all the people get to speak \u2014 to compete? It is clear, absolutely clear \u2014 and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country \u2014 that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don\u2019t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It\u2019s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. We\u2019ve got to prove democracy works. Q\u00a0 And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven\u2019t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you\u2019ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control. THE PRESIDENT: All the above. It\u2019s a matter of timing. As you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents \u2014 better than me \u2014 have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing \u2014 order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done. The next major initiative is \u2014 and I\u2019ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail \u2014 is to rebuild the infrastructure \u2014 both physical and technological infrastructure in this country \u2014 so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs. And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don\u2019t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide. Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what\u2019s the first thing that businesses asked? \u201cWhat\u2019s the closest access to \u2014 access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water \u2014 is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?\u201d All the things that relate to infrastructure. We have somewhere \u2014 I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did \u2014 not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure \u2014 we have \u2014 we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is. Bridges: More than one third of our bridges \u2014 231,000 of them \u2014 need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That\u2019s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights \u2014 20 percent of all flights weren\u2019t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane. What are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and \u2014 to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells. So, I \u2014 I just find it frustrated \u2014 frustrating to talk about. Last point I\u2019ll make on the infrastructure \u2014 and I apologize for spending more time on it, but \u2014 is that if you think about it, it\u2019s the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can\u2019t build back to what they used to be. We have to build \u2014 the environment has \u2014 global warming has already done significant damage. The roads that used to be above the water level \u2014 didn\u2019t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was \u2014 now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it\u2019s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it. There\u2019s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re all from \u2014 how many schools where the kids can\u2019t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there\u2019s asbestos? How many schools in America we\u2019re sending our kids to don\u2019t have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can\u2019t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It\u2019s amazing. So there\u2019s so much we can do that\u2019s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs. And I think that I got one more question here. Janet from Univision. Q\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP \u2014 had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. \u00a0We have contacted the mother. That\u2019s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing? THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re already getting better, but they\u2019re going to get real \u2014 they\u2019ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we\u2019re going to hear of some people leaving, okay? We can get this done. We\u2019re going to get it done. I had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We\u2019re going to be moving, within the next \u2014 within the next week, over 100,000 \u2014 I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We\u2019re going to significantly ramp up. We\u2019re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of them doing other things \u2014 and move them into making those calls. We\u2019re in a \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done. But I admire the fact that you were down there; you\u2019re making the calls yourself. It\u2019s real. The next thing that has to happen though \u2014 as you well know has to happen \u2014 there have to be some certitude that this is the \u2014 actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there\u2019s ways to do that. There\u2019s ways to do that \u2014 a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? \u201cWhat was your dog\u2019s name?\u201d kind of a thing. I\u2019m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to \u2014 to birth certificates, which takes longer.\u00a0 So, I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible. Q\u00a0 As you well know, treating the root cau- \u2014 causes in Latin America doesn\u2019t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can\u2019t guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step. You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious \u2014 it\u2019s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala \u2014 I mean, in \u2014 in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying, \u201cI got a great idea. Let\u2019s sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don\u2019t speak the language. Won\u2019t that be fun? Let\u2019s go.\u201d That\u2019s not how it happens. People don\u2019t want to leave. When my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn\u2019t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people. And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it\u2019s much more heart wrenching \u2014 and it is \u2014 to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children \u2014 70 percent \u2014 are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn\u2019t make it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night \u2014 and there\u2019s some; that\u2019s true. That\u2019s why we got to act. And yesterday, I asked my team \u2014 both the director of the two agencies, as well as others \u2014 I asked them what would they, in fact \u2014 and I asked their opinion because they\u2019re the experts \u2014 but I said, \u201cFocus on the most vulnerable immediately.\u201d But there\u2019s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can\u2019t be made in the first 48 hours and begin. Q\u00a0 If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved? THE PRESIDENT: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a \u2014 but I\u2019m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better. But, folks, I\u2019m going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. ",

        "transcript": " THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight, I\u2019d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness. Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family. While it was different for everyone, we all lost something. A collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life \u2014 and the loss of living for all of us. But, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives \u2014 sometimes losing them \u2014 to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. I know it\u2019s been hard. I truly know. As I\u2019ve told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It\u2019s on the back of my schedule. As of now, the total deaths in America: 527,726. That\u2019s more deaths than in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined. They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors \u2014 young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral. But I\u2019m also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident, or other diseases. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave loved ones behind who are hurting badly. You know, you\u2019ve often heard me say before, I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child\u2019s bedroom to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lost my job. We can\u2019t be here anymore.\u201d Like my Dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton. So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year. You lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and, maybe worst of all, a loss of hope. Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more \u2014 because they\u2019ve not been in school \u2014 because of their loss of learning. It\u2019s the details of life that matter most, and we\u2019ve missed those details. The big details and small moments. Weddings, birthdays, graduations \u2014 all the things that needed to happen but didn\u2019t. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals. It\u2019s all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others \u2014 to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another. But this virus has kept us apart. Grandparents haven\u2019t seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven\u2019t seen their kids. Kids haven\u2019t seen their friends. The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn\u2019t do and broke our hearts. Too often, we\u2019ve turned against one another. A mask \u2014 the easiest thing to do to save lives \u2014 sometimes it divides us. States pitted against one other instead of working with each other. Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them \u2014 our fellow Americans \u2014 they\u2019re on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still \u2014 still \u2014 they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s un-American, and it must stop. Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people \u2014 no function more important. We need to remember the government isn\u2019t some foreign force in a distant capital. No, it\u2019s us. All of us. \u201cWe the People.\u201d For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And I have to say, as your President, I am grateful to you. Last summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business owner \u2014 a woman. I asked her \u2014 I said, \u201cWhat do you need most?\u201d I\u2019ll never forget what she said to me. She said \u2014 looking me in the eye, she said, \u201cI just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth.\u201d Think of that. My fellow Americans, you\u2019re owed nothing less than the truth. And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus. You\u2019ve been hearing me say that for \u2014 while I was running and the last 50 days I\u2019ve been President. But this is one of the most complex operations we\u2019ve under- \u2014 ever undertaken as a nation in a long time. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it: a war footing. And thank God we\u2019re making some real progress now. On my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. And we have spent every day since attempting to carry it out. Two months ago, the country \u2014 this country didn\u2019t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the American public. But soon we will. We\u2019ve been working with the vaccine manufacturers \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson \u2014 to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is one shot. In fact, just yesterday, I announced \u2014 and I met with the CEOs of both companies \u2014 I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccines. These two companies \u2014 competitors \u2014 have come together for the good of the nation, and they should be applauded for it. It\u2019s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II. Now because of all the work we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That\u2019s months ahead of schedule. And we\u2019re mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one\u2019s arm. Calling on active duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots. And we\u2019ve been creating more places to get the shots. We\u2019ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one \u2014 any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot. We\u2019re also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour. We\u2019ve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we\u2019ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it. We continue to work on making at-home testing available. And we\u2019ve been focused on serving people in the hardest-hit communities of this pandemic \u2014 Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. So, what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after months \u2014 only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly] 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent. With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 the CDC \u2014 that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC] will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with friends, and as well as travel. When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days in office. Tonight, I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we\u2019re going to beat that goal. Because we\u2019re actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None. Now I want to talk about the next steps we\u2019re thinking about. First, tonight, I\u2019m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes, and territories to make all adults \u2014 people 18 and over \u2014 eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That\u2019s much earlier than expected. Let me be clear: That doesn\u2019t mean everyone\u2019s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you\u2019ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot. To do this, we\u2019re going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintaining \u2014 beating our current pace of two million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world. Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan \u2014 and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it \u2014 and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about 100 million shots, of opening the majority of K-8 schools in my first 100 days in office. This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona. Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated. And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that\u2019s not hyperbole. I need you. I need you to get vaccinated when it\u2019s your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well. Because here\u2019s the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there\u2019s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn\u2019t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together. After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus. But to get there, we can\u2019t let our guard down. This fight is far from order \u2014 from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, \u201cI will tell you the truth.\u201d A July 4th with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal \u2014 a lot can happen; conditions can change. The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread. And we\u2019ve got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines. So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He has assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they\u2019re safe. Vice President Harris and I know they\u2019re safe. That\u2019s why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so \u2014 for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated. Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors \u2014 the people you know best who\u2019ve gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC. Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. And national unity isn\u2019t just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don\u2019t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don\u2019t want to do again. We\u2019ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules. I\u2019ll close with this. We\u2019ve lost so much over the last year. We\u2019ve lost family and friends. We\u2019ve lost businesses and dreams we spent years building. We\u2019ve lost time \u2014 time with each other. And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this \u2014 this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies. You know, and there\u2019s something else we lost. We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people. But as I stand here tonight, we\u2019re proving once again something I have said time and time again until they\u2019re probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It\u2019s never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back. The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another. And today, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks \u2014 payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check \u2014 a Treasury check. It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers healthcare premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it fi- \u2014 and it funds all the steps I\u2019ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs. In the coming weeks and months, I\u2019ll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any pa-, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not. About how after a long, dark years \u2014 one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead. If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we will have proven once again that this country can do anything \u2014 hard things, big things, important things. Over a year ago, no one could\u2019ve imagined what we were about to go through, but now we\u2019re coming through it, and it\u2019s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we\u2019re also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us. My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we\u2019ll come together as one people, one nation, one America. I believe we can and we will. We\u2019re seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation\u2019s history \u2014 darkest we\u2019ve ever known. I promise you, we\u2019ll come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country. This is the United States of America, and there is nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 from the bottom of my heart, I believe this \u2014 there is nothing we can\u2019t do when we do it together. So God bless you all. And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone. And may God protect our troops. Thank you for taking the time to listen. I look forward to seeing you. ",

        "intro": "Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021. In his Inaugural Address, he stressed the need for the country to come together in unity. Speaking to those who voted for him and to those who did not, Biden made the strong case that together the country could move forward to contain the coronavirus pandemic and improve the economy. His address was in stark contrast to President Donald Trump's Inaugural Address four years earlier.\u00a0\n",
        "transcript": " Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans. This is America\u2019s day. This is democracy\u2019s day. A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol\u2019s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. We look ahead in our uniquely American way \u2013 restless, bold, optimistic \u2013 and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation. As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took \u2014 an oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On \u201cWe the People\u201d who seek a more perfect Union. This is a great nation and we are a good people. Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go. We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. Much to repair. Much to restore. Much to heal. Much to build. And much to gain. Few periods in our nation\u2019s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u2019re in now. A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. It\u2019s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can\u2019t be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges \u2013 to restore the soul and to secure the future of America \u2013 requires more than words. It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. Unity. In another January in Washington, on New Year\u2019s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, \u201cIf my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.\u201d My whole soul is in it. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: Anger, resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness, hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus. We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice. We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is never assured. Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \u201cbetter angels\u201d have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And, we can do so now. History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together. And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. All of us. Let us listen to one another. Hear one another. See one another. Show respect to one another. Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war. And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And, I believe America is better than this. Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance. Yet we endured and we prevailed. Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office \u2013 Vice President Kamala Harris. Don\u2019t tell me things can\u2019t change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. That did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That\u2019s democracy. That\u2019s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation\u2019s greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans? I think I know. Opportunity. Security. Liberty. Dignity. Respect. Honor. And, yes, the truth. Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders \u2013 leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation \u2014 to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next. I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don\u2019t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don\u2019t get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility. If we\u2019re willing to stand in the other person\u2019s shoes just for a moment. Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. There are some days when we need a hand. There are other days when we\u2019re called on to lend one. That is how we must be with one another. And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. I promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this, together The world is watching today. So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday\u2019s challenges, but today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s. We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. We have been through so much in this nation. And, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. To those 400,000 fellow Americans \u2013 mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. Amen. This is a time of testing. We face an attack on democracy and on truth. A raging virus. Growing inequity. The sting of systemic racism. A climate in crisis. America\u2019s role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. Now we must step up. All of us. It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And, this is certain. We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children? I believe we must and I believe we will. And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story. It\u2019s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It\u2019s called \u201cAmerican Anthem\u201d and there is one verse stands out for me: \u201cThe work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?\u2026 Let me know in my heart When my days are through America America I gave my best to you.\u201d Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children\u2019s children will say of us they gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land. My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America. I will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities. Not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness. An American story of decency and dignity. Of love and of healing. Of greatness and of goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. We met the moment. That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. Sustained by faith. Driven by conviction. And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America. ",
